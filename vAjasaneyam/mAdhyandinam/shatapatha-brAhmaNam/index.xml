      <description>01 Once upon a time the gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Prajāpati, strove together. And the Asuras, even through arrogance, thinking, &amp;lsquo;Unto whom, forsooth, should we make offering?&amp;rsquo; went on offering into their own mouths. They came to naught, even through arrogance: wherefore let no one be arrogant, for verily arrogance is the cause 1 of ruin. 02 But the gods went on making offerings unto one another.</description>

      <description>The ceremonies begin with the preparation of the sacrificial fires. [First, the fivefold lustration successively of the Āhavanīya and Dakshiṇāgni fire-places, to render them fit for receiving the fire from the Gārhapatya or householder&amp;rsquo;s fire, viz. by thrice sweeping the hearths; thrice besmearing them with gomaya; drawing three lines across them from west to east, or south to north, with the wooden sword (sphya); removing the dust from the lines with the thumb and ring-finger; and thrice sprinkling the lines with water 1.</description>

      <description>01 Then, early next morning 1, when about to bespeak the morning prayer 2, he yokes the Fire-altar, thinking, &amp;lsquo;With it, when yoked, I shall obtain; and by it, when yoked, he obtains all wishes. He yokes it prior to the whole performance, so that all that is done thereafter is laden on that yoked (altar-cart).
02 He yokes it on the enclosing-sticks, for those enclosing-sticks are fires 3: it is with fires he thus yokes the fire-altar.</description>

      <description>01 Thereupon they sit down round the two press-boards 1. He (the Adhvaryu) then ties a piece of gold to that (nameless finger). For twofold, verily, is this; there is no third, namely, the truth and the untruth; the gods, forsooth, are the truth, and men are the untruth. And the gold has sprung from Agni&amp;rsquo;s seed: &amp;lsquo;With the truth I will touch the stalks, with the truth I will take hold of Soma,&amp;rsquo; thus he thinks, and therefore he ties a piece of gold to that (ring-finger).</description>

      <description>01 He offers a full-offering 1; for the full means the All: &amp;lsquo;May I be consecrated after encompassing the All!&amp;rsquo; thus he thinks. At this (offering) he bestows a boon; for a boon means all: &amp;lsquo;Having encompassed the All (the universe), may I be consecrated! thus he thinks. He may perform this offering, if he chooses; or, if he chooses, he may disregard it. 02 And on the following day he prepares a cake on eight potsherds, as sacrificial food for Anumati 2.</description>

      <description>01 Verily, by means of the Varuṇapraghāsāḥ Prajāpati delivered the creatures from Varuṇa&amp;rsquo;s noose; and those creatures of his were born without disease and blemish. Now with these Sākamedha offerings,&amp;ndash;therewith indeed the gods slew Vr̥tra, therewith they gained that supreme authority which they now wield; and so does he now therewith slay his wicked, spiteful enemy and gain the victory: this is why he performs these offerings in the fourth month (after the Varuṇapraghāsāḥ).</description>

      <description>01 They also say, &amp;lsquo;If that performer of a long sacrificial session&amp;ndash;to wit, he who (regularly) offers the Agnihotra&amp;ndash;were to die whilst staying abroad, are they to sacrifice for him or not?&amp;rsquo; Now, some indeed think that (his Agnihotra) should be offered till they get home 1; but let him not do so, for that (fire) does not submit thereto that they should offer to it, as for the burning of a dead body: it is rather to sacrifice and oblations that it submits, and, unable to endure it, it stays by him with impatience.</description>

      <description>01 The sacrifice is a man; it is a man for the reason that a man spreads (prepares) it. In being spread it is made just as large 1 as a man: this is why the sacrifice is a man. 02 The Soma-cart (shed) is no other than his head, and has Vishṇu for its deity 2. And because Soma is therein&amp;ndash;Soma being havis (material for offering) for the gods&amp;ndash;therefore it is called Havirdhāna (receptacle of havis).</description>

      <description>01 On the day of preparation, early in the morning, when the sun has risen, he releases his speech. Having released his speech, he takes clarified butter, in five ladlings, and throws five chips of gold thereon. Then these three (materials), sour curds, honey and ghee, are poured together, either into a dish, or a pot with a wide mouth; and he puts a handful of sacrificial grass thereon.
02 He then mounts the fire-altar, with (Vāj.</description>

      <description>01 Now, Indrota Daivāpa Śaunaka once performed this sacrifice for Janamejaya Pārikshita, and by performing it he extinguished all evil-doing, all Brahman-slaughter; and, verily, he who performs the Aśvamedha extinguishes (the guilt incurred by) all evil-doing, all Brahman-slaughter. 02 It is of this, indeed, that the Gāthā (strophe) sings,&amp;ndash;&amp;lsquo;In Āsandīvat 1, Janamejaya bound for the gods a black-spotted, grain-eating horse, adorned with a golden ornament and with yellow garlands.&amp;rsquo; 03 [There are] those same first two days 2, and a Jyotis 3 Atirātra: therewith (they sacrificed) for Bhīmasena;&amp;ndash;those same first two days, and a Go Atirātra: therewith (they sacrificed) for Ugrasena;&amp;ndash;those same first two days, and an Āyus Atirātra: therewith (they sacrificed) for Śrutasena.</description>

      <description>01 Verily, they who perform an Agnihotra enter upon a long sacrificial session:&amp;ndash;the Agnihotra, indeed, is a sacrificial session ensuring death in old age 1, for people are set free from it either by old age or by death. 02 Here, now, they say, &amp;lsquo;If either a team (yukta) were to drive through, or people were to walk to and fro, between the two fires of such a one performing an Agnihotra, and (being thus) a performer of a long session, what rite and what expiation would there be in that case?</description>

      <description>01 Now this&amp;ndash;to wit, the sacrifice&amp;ndash;is the self of all beings, and of all gods: after its successful consummation the Sacrificer prospers in offspring (or, people) and cattle; but he whose Gharma (pot) is shattered is deprived of his offspring and cattle. In that case there is an expiation. 02 He offers an oblation of a full (spoon of ghee); for the full means everything: with everything he thus heals whatever has been unsuccessful in the sacrifice.</description>

      <description>01 Verily, Prajāpati, the sacrifice, is King Soma; and these deities to whom he offers, and these oblations which he offers, are forms of him. 02 If any part of the sacrifice were to fail, let him make an oblation with regard to that same deity for whom he may have intended (that part),&amp;ndash;on the Āhavanīya, if it is during the initiation and the Upasads; on the Āgnīdhra, if it is at the Soma-pressing;&amp;ndash;for whatever joint of the sacrifice fails, that breaks; and whichever then is the deity in that (part of the sacrifice) through that deity he heals the sacrifice, through that one he makes the sacrifice complete again 1.</description>

      <description>01 Now, then, of the expiations. If the sacrificial horse were to couple with a mare, let him in addition prepare a milk (oblation) to Vāyu;&amp;ndash;Vāyu doubtless is the transformer of seeds, for Vāyu (the wind) is the vital air, and the vital air is the transformer of seeds: by means of seed he thus puts seed into it.
02 And if disease were to befal it, let him in addition prepare a pap to Pūshan, for Pūshan rules over beasts (cattle); and, indeed, he thereby gratifies him who owns cattle and rules over cattle; and it (the horse) thereby indeed becomes free from disease.</description>

For now, having laid down the fourth layer, the gods mounted it,&amp;ndash;having completed what is above the air, and below the sky, they mounted it. 02 They spake, &amp;lsquo;Meditate ye (cetay)!&amp;rsquo; whereby, doubtless, they meant to say, &amp;lsquo;Seek ye a layer (citi)! Seek ye from hence upwards!&amp;rsquo; Whilst meditating, they saw that fifth layer, the far-shining heaven: that world pleased them. 03 They desired, &amp;lsquo;Would that we could make that world foeless, undisturbed!</description>

They now prepare a burial-place (śmaśāna 2) for him, (to serve him) either as a house or as a monument; for when any one dies, he is a corpse (śava), and for that (corpse) food (anna) is thereby prepared, hence &amp;lsquo;śavanna,&amp;rsquo; for, indeed, &amp;lsquo;śavanna&amp;rsquo; is what is mystically called &amp;lsquo;śmaśāna.&amp;rsquo; But &amp;lsquo;śmaśāḥ&amp;rsquo; also are called the eaters amongst the Fathers, and they, indeed, destroy in yonder world the good deeds of him who has had no sepulchre prepared for him: it is for them that he prepares that food, whence it is &amp;lsquo;śmaśānna,&amp;rsquo; for &amp;lsquo;śmaśānna&amp;rsquo; is what is mystically called &amp;lsquo;śmaśāna.</description>

      <description>01 Now Soma was in the sky, and the gods were here on earth. The gods desired,&amp;ndash;&amp;lsquo;Would that Soma came to us: we might sacrifice with him, when come.&amp;rsquo; They created those two illusions, Suparṇī and Kadrū. In the chapter on the hearths (dhishṇya 1) it is set forth how that affair of Suparṇī and Kadrū came to pass. 02 Gāyatrī flew up to Soma for them. While she was carrying him off, the Gandharva Viśvāvasu stole him from her.</description>

      <description>01 Prajāpati alone, indeed, existed here in the beginning. He considered, &amp;lsquo;How may I be reproduced?&amp;rsquo; He toiled and performed acts of penance. He generated Agni from his mouth; and because he generated him from his mouth, therefore Agni is a consumer of food: and, verily, he who thus knows Agni to be a consumer of food, becomes himself a consumer of food.
02 He thus generated him first (agre) of the gods; and therefore (he is called) Agni, for agni (they say) is the same as agri.</description>

      <description>01 Now the living beings once approached Prajāpati&amp;ndash;beings doubtless mean creatures&amp;ndash;and said, &amp;lsquo;Ordain unto us in what manner we are to live!&amp;rsquo; Thereupon the gods, being properly invested with the sacrificial cord 1 and bending the right knee, approached him. To them he said, &amp;lsquo;The sacrifice (shall be) your food; immortality your sap; and the sun your light!&amp;rsquo; 02 Then the fathers approached, wearing the cord on the right shoulder, and bending the left knee.</description>

      <description>01 He then offers the Vaiśvānara (cake). That Agni has now been completely restored; he now is that deity, (Agni) Vaiśvānara (belonging to all men): to him he offers this oblation, and by the oblation he makes him a deity, for whatever deity an oblation is prepared that is a deity, but not one for whom no (oblation) is prepared. It is one of twelve potsherds: twelve months are a year, and Vaiśvānara is the year.</description>

The Asuras then defiled, partly by magic, partly with poison, both kinds of plants&amp;ndash;those on which men and beasts subsist&amp;ndash;hoping that in this way they might over come the gods.</description>

For now that Agni was about to go forward (to the fire-altar), the gods regaled him with food, both with oblations and pieces of firewood; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer), now that he (Agni) is about to go forward, regale him with food, both with oblations and pieces of firewood.</description>

      <description>01 He (the Adhvaryu) cooks the priests’ mess of rice 1: it is seed he thereby produces. Having greased a rope with the ghee which is left over 2, he takes it; for ghee is (a type of) fiery spirit, and the horse is sacred to Prajāpati 3: he thus endows Prajāpati with fiery spirit. Impure, and unfit for sacrifice, indeed, is that (animal), to wit, the horse. 02 The rope consists of darbha grass (poa cynosuroides);&amp;ndash;for darbha stalks 4 are a means of purification: he thus purifies that (horse), and immolates it as one purified and meet for sacrifice.</description>

      <description>01 Verily, the guest-offering is the head of the sacrifice, and the Prāyaṇīya and Udayanīya are its arms. But the arms are on both sides of the head: therefore those two oblations, the Prāyaṇīya and Udayanīya, are on both sides of the guest-offering. 02 Now as to why it is called &amp;lsquo;guest-offering.&amp;rsquo; He, the purchased Soma, truly comes as his (the sacrificer&amp;rsquo;s) guest,&amp;ndash;to him (is offered) that (hospitable reception): even as for a king or a Brāhman one would cook a large ox or a large he-goat&amp;ndash;for that is human (fare offered to a guest), and the oblation is that of the gods&amp;ndash;so he prepares for him that guest-offering.</description>

      <description>01 When the gods had performed the guest-offering, discord arose between them. They allayed it by means of the Tānūnaptra (oaths). They desired an atonement for having spoken evil to one another; for they had appointed no other consecration-ceremony till the expiatory bath. They perceived this intermediate consecration 1. 02 By means of fire they enveloped (the body) with a skin. Now, fire being fervour, and the consecration being fervour, they thereby underwent an intermediate consecration; and because they underwent that intermediate consecration, therefore this intermediary consecration (avāntaradīkshā, is performed).</description>

02 And as to why he offers two Rauhiṇa (cakes),&amp;ndash;the two Rauhiṇas doubtless are Agni and Āditya (the sun), for by means of these two deities sacrificers ascend (ruh) to heaven.</description>

      <description>01 Being about to build Agni (the fire-altar), he takes him up into his own self; for from out of his own self he causes him to be born, and wherefrom one is born, suchlike he becomes. Now were he to build up Agni without taking him up into his own self, he would beget man from man, mortal from mortal, one not freed from sin from one not freed from sin; but when he builds up Agni after taking him up into his own self, he causes Agni to be born from Agni, the immortal from the immortal, the sinless from the sinless.</description>

      <description>01 He lays down the Prāṇabhr̥taḥ (breath-holders) 1: now, the Prāṇabhr̥taḥ being&amp;ndash;the vital airs, it is the vital airs he thereby bestows upon (Agni). He lays them down in the first layer;&amp;ndash;that which is the first layer is the forepart (ground-part) of Agni: it is thus in front that he puts (into Agni) the vital airs, whence there are (in creatures) these (orifices of the) vital airs in front.
02 He lays them down by ten and ten, for there are ten vital airs; and even though &amp;rsquo;ten-ten&amp;rsquo; may mean many, times, here they mean only ten.</description>

      <description>01 Having thrown the (earth of the) foot-print (into the pan), he (the Adhvaryu) washes his hands. Now as to why he washes his hands;&amp;ndash;clarified butter being a thunderbolt, and the Soma being seed, he washes his hands lest 1 he should injure the seed, Soma, with the thunderbolt, the ghee. 02 Thereupon he ties the piece of gold to this (finger 2). Now, twofold indeed is this (universe),&amp;ndash;there is no third,&amp;ndash;the truth and the untruth: the gods are the truth and men are the untruth.</description>

      <description>01 Verily, whoever exists, he, in being born, is born as (owing) a debt to the gods, to the R̥shis, to the fathers, and to men 1. 02 For, inasmuch as he is bound to sacrifice, for that reason he is born as (owing) a debt to the gods: hence when he sacrifices to them, when he makes offerings to them, he does this (in discharge of his debt) to them.</description>

      <description>Here also two days were, as a rule, required for the performance, both at full and new moon; but while, at the ordinary sacrifice,
At full moon some authorities add a special ishṭi to Indra Vimr̥dh (&amp;rsquo;the Averter of evil&amp;rsquo;). The new-moon performance concludes with libations of whey to the divine coursers (the horses of the gods); and, optionally, with an ishṭi to Āditya.
The performance of the Dākshāyaṇa sacrifice was held to be obligatory only for a period of fifteen years (see XI, 1, 2, 13), whereas the ordinary new and full-moon offerings had to be performed for double that period from the setting up of the sacred fires.</description>

      <description>01 Now when Varuṇa was consecrated, his lustre departed from him,&amp;ndash;lustre means vigour: that Vishṇu, the Sacrifice, it was he that departed from him,&amp;ndash;probably that collected essence of the waters wherewith he is anointed on that occasion, drove out his lustre. 02 He stole after it with those deities 1,&amp;ndash;with Savitr̥, the impeller (prasavitr̥); with Sarasvatī, speech; with Tvashṭr̥, the forms of being; with Pūshan, cattle; with Indra, on the part of him 2 (the Sacrificer); with Br̥haspati, holiness; with Varuṇa, might; with Agni, fiery spirit; with Soma, the King; &amp;ndash;but only through Vishṇu 3, the tenth deity, he found it.</description>

      <description>01 Many 1 are the oblations, in the building of the fire-altar, as well as at any other (special ceremony) than the building of the fire-altar. For there are supernumerary rites,&amp;ndash;supernumerary are those which are (performed) over and above another rite: of these 2 are the building of the altar (Agnicityā), the Rājasūya, the Vājapeya, and the Aśvamedha; and because they are over and above the other (normal) rites, therefore they are supernumerary.</description>

Of them, being all alike, all good, three desired, &amp;lsquo;May we be superior 1!&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;Agni, Indra, and Sūrya. 02 They went on praising and toiling. They saw those Atigrāhyas 3, and drew (grah) them for themselves over and above (ati): hence the name Atigrāhyas.

The gods said to him, &amp;lsquo;Surely, this&amp;ndash;to wit, the Aśvamedha&amp;ndash;is a sacrifice: let us have a share in that also.&amp;rsquo; He contrived these Anna-homas (food-oblations) for them: thus when he performs the Annahomas, it is the gods he thereby gratifies.

From the body of him, when wearied and heated, the deities departed in a sevenfold way: therefrom the Dīkshā (initiation) was produced. He perceived those Vaiśvadeva 2 (oblations). He offered them, and by means of them he gained the Dīkshā: and when the Sacrificer offers the Vaiśvadeva (oblations) it is the Dīkshā he thereby gains. Day after day he offers them: day after day he thus gains the Dīkshā 3.</description>

      <description>01 When he has performed the Consecration-ceremony (Abhishecanīya), he does not shave his hair. The reason why he does not shave his hair (is this):&amp;ndash;that collected essence of the waters wherewith he is then sprinkled (anointed) is vigour, and it is the hair (of his head) that it reaches first when he is sprinkled; hence were he to shave his hair, he would cause that glory to fall off from him, and would sweep it away: therefore he does not shave his hair.</description>

And with the kindling verses (sāmidhenī) the Hotr̥ kindles (sam-indh, to make blaze): hence they are called kindling verses. 02 He (the Adhvaryu 1) says (to the Hotr̥): &amp;lsquo;Recite to the fire as it is being kindled!&amp;rsquo; for it is to the fire, when it is being kindled, that he recites. 03 Here now some people say, &amp;lsquo;O Hotar, recite to the fire as it is being kindled!</description>

      <description>01 That water (used for working the clay) has been boiled by means of resin of the palāśa tree (butea frondosa), just for the sake of firmness. And as to why (it is done) by palāśa resin;&amp;ndash;the palāśa tree doubtless is Soma 1, and Soma is the moon, and that (moon) indeed is one of Agni&amp;rsquo;s forms: it is for the obtainment of that form of Agni (that palāśa resin is used).</description>

She stood there resplendent, shining, and trembling 2. The gods, beholding her thus resplendent, shining, and trembling, set their minds upon her. 02 They said to Prajāpati, &amp;lsquo;Let us kill her and take (all) this from her.&amp;rsquo; He said, &amp;lsquo;Surely, that Śrī is a woman, and people do not kill a woman, but rather take (anything) from her (leaving her) alive.</description>

When Prajāpati became relaxed, the vital fluid flowed upwards 3. 02 Now, that Prajāpati who became relaxed is the year; and those joints of his which became relaxed are the days and nights. 03 And that Prajāpati who became relaxed is this very Fire-altar which here is built; and those joints of his, the days and nights, which became relaxed are no other than the bricks;&amp;ndash;thus, when he lays down these (in the layers of the altar), he thereby restores to him those joints of his, the days and nights, which had become relaxed: and thus it is even in this (building of the altar) that this Yajus is built up 4 and secured (for Prajāpati).</description>

      <description>01 When he has taken out the Āhavanīya fire 1, he performs the Full-offering 2. The reason why he performs the full-offering is that he thereby causes that Agni to become an eater of food for his own self; that he thereby offers food to him. Even as (a mother or cow) would offer the breast to a new-born child or calf, so does he thereby offer food to him.</description>

      <description>01 Being about to perform the patnīsaṁyājas 1, they betake themselves back to the Gārhapatya fire. The Adhvaryu takes the juhū and sruva, the Hotr̥ the veda, and the Āgnīdhra the butter-(melting) pot. 02 Here now the Adhvaryu, according to some, passes the Āhavanīya on the east side. Let him not, however, do this; for were he to walk on that side, he would be outside the sacrifice. 03 According to others, the Adhvaryu walks (so as to pass) behind the (sacrificer&amp;rsquo;s) wife 2.</description>

He also whom they chose the second time passed away. He also whom they chose the third time passed away 1.

For when the gods at that time were about to search (for Agni) in these (animals) they placed their vigour in front; and in like manner does this one, now that he is about to search in these (animals), place his vigour in front.
02 He addresses the horse, with (Vāj. S.

      <description>01 Verily, this&amp;ndash;to wit, the Aśvamedha&amp;ndash;is the king of sacrifices. But, indeed, the Aśvamedha is the Sacrificer, (for) the sacrifice is the Sacrificer: when he (the priest) binds victims to the horse (or, at the horse-sacrifice), he then, indeed, takes hold 1 of the sacrifice at the sacrifice. 02 &amp;lsquo;A horse, a hornless he-goat, and a Gomr̥ga 2&amp;rsquo; these they bind to the central stake: thereby, indeed, he (the priest) sharpens the front of his (the Sacrificer&amp;rsquo;s) army 3, whence the front of the king&amp;rsquo;s army is sure to become terrible.</description>

      <description>01 Now, on the third, or the sixth, or the twelfth day 1, having combined (the two performances of) the Pravargya and Upasads 2, he &amp;lsquo;sets out 3&amp;rsquo; the Pravargya, for set out (removed), as it were, is this head (from the trunk). Having gathered together all around it 4 (the Mahāvīra pot), they meet together upon the Vedi in the Śālā, (entering) by the front door.
02 The Āgnīdhra then brings three bundles of faggots to the Āhavanīya, and kindling one of them, he offers (thereon) whilst holding it 5 on a level with (the Sacrificer&amp;rsquo;s) mouth.</description>

      <description>01 They (the priests) are wakened (towards morning). Having touched water 1, they proceed together to the Āgnīdhra (fire-house) and take the portions of ghee (for the Savanīya animal offerings). Having taken the portions of ghee, they betake themselves (to the high altar). When they have deposited the ghee,&amp;ndash; 02 He (the Adhvaryu) takes down the king (Soma) 2. Now this (earth) is a safe resting-place, and the birth-place of living beings; it is to this safe resting-place that he now takes him down; he spreads him thereon, produces him therefrom.</description>

      <description>01 Then, on the morrow, there is (used) Gotama&amp;rsquo;s Stoma (form of chanting) successively increasing by four (verses) 1: the Bahishpavamāna thereof is on four, the Ājya (stotras) on eight, the Mādhyandina Pavamāna on twelve, the Pr̥shṭḥa (stotras) on sixteen, the Ārbhava Pavamāna on twenty, and the Agnishṭoma-sāman on twenty-four (verses).
02 Now, some make its Agnishṭoma-sāman a Sāman of four (verses), saying, &amp;lsquo;It is neither an Agnishṭoma, nor an Ukthya 2.</description>

      <description>01 There are five great sacrifices, and they, indeed, are great sacrificial sessions,&amp;ndash;to wit, the sacrifice to beings, the sacrifice to men, the sacrifice to the Fathers, the sacrifice to the gods, and the sacrifice to the Brahman. 02 Day by day one should offer an oblation to beings: thus he performs that sacrifice to beings. Day by day one should offer (presents to guests) up to the cupful of water 1: thus he performs that sacrifice to men.</description>

      <description>01 When the gods had performed the guest-offering, discord befell them. They separated into four different parties, unwilling to yield to each other&amp;rsquo;s excellence,&amp;ndash;Agni, with the Vasus, Soma with the Rudras, Varuṇa with the Ādityas, and Indra with the Maruts. Br̥haspati with the All-gods, say some 1, but, indeed, those who separated into four parties were &amp;lsquo;all the gods.&amp;rsquo; When they were separated, the Asura-Rakshas came after them and entered between them.</description>

      <description>01 He lays down the third layer. For the gods, having laid down the second layer, now ascended it; but, indeed, they thereby completed and ascended to what is above the earth and below the atmosphere. 02 They spate, &amp;lsquo;Meditate ye!&amp;rsquo; whereby, indeed, they meant to say, &amp;lsquo;Seek ye a layer! Seek ye (to build) upwards from hence!&amp;rsquo; Whilst meditating, they saw the great third layer, even the air: that world pleased them.</description>

      <description>01 Now the Seasons were desirous to have a share in the sacrifice among the gods, and said, &amp;lsquo;Let us share in the sacrifice! Do not exclude us from the sacrifice! Let us have a share in the sacrifice!&amp;rsquo; 02 The gods, however, did not approve of this. The gods not approving, the Seasons went to the Asuras, the malignant, spiteful enemies of the gods. 03 Those (Asuras) then throve in such a manner that they (the gods) heard of it; for even while the foremost (of the Asuras) were still ploughing and sowing, those behind them were already engaged in reaping and threshing: indeed even without tilling the plants ripened forthwith for them.</description>

      <description>01 Verily the Upasads (homages or sieges) are the neck of the sacrifice, and the Pravargya is its head. Hence when it is performed with the Pravargya 1, they perform the Upasads 2 after performing the Pravargya, and thereby they put the neck in its place.
02 The anuvākyās (invitatory prayers) in the forenoon are the yājyās (offering prayers) in the afternoon; and the yājyās are the anuvākyās 3. He thus interlinks them, whence those joints and those bones of the neck are interlinked.</description>

      <description>01 Verily he who consecrates himself, consecrates himself for the sake of this All; for he consecrates himself for the sacrifice, and this All indeed results from 1 the sacrifice; having prepared the sacrifice for which he consecrates himself, he now sets free (or produces) this All. 02 The reason why he performs the Vaisarjina offerings is this. They are called Vaisarjina, because he sets free (vi-sarj) this All; wherefore let him who takes part in the rite 2 touch (the sacrificer) from behind; but if he have to go elsewhere (on business) he need not heed this.</description>

      <description>01 Now as to the offering of the omenta. &amp;lsquo;They should proceed with them singly up to the omentum of the Vaiśvadeva (victim) 1; and when the omentum of the Vaiśvadeva has been offered, they should thereupon offer the others,&amp;rsquo; said Satyakāma Jābāla; &amp;lsquo;for, doubtless, the All-Gods (Viśve Devāḥ) are all (sarve) the gods: it is in this way he gratifies them deity after deity.&amp;rsquo; 02 &amp;lsquo;When the omentum of the Aindrāgna (victim) has been offered, they should thereupon offer the others,&amp;rsquo; said the two Saumapa Mānutantavya;&amp;lsquo;for, doubtless, Indra and Agni are all the gods: it is in this way he gratifies them deity after deity.</description>

      <description>01 Now, when the head of the sacrifice (victim) was struck off, its sap, running, entered the waters. It is by that very sap that those waters flow; that very sap is believed to be flowing there 1. 02 And when he goes for the Vasatīvarī water, he fetches that same sap and puts it into the sacrifice, and makes the sacrifice sapful; this is why he goes for the Vasatīvarī water.</description>

      <description>01 Thereupon he takes the winnowing basket and the Agnihotra ladle 1, with the text (Vāj. S. I, 6 b): &amp;lsquo;For the work (I take) you, for pervasion (or accomplishment) you two!&amp;rsquo; For the sacrifice is a work: hence, in saying &amp;lsquo;for the work you two,&amp;rsquo; he says, &amp;lsquo;for the sacrifice.&amp;rsquo; And &amp;lsquo;for pervasion you two,&amp;rsquo; he says, because he, as it were, pervades (goes through, accomplishes) the sacrifice.
02 He then restrains his speech; for (restrained) speech means undisturbed sacrifice; so that (in so doing) he thinks: &amp;lsquo;May I accomplish the sacrifice!</description>

      <description>01 He now prepares two strainers (pavitra) 1, with the text (Vāj. S. I, 12 a): &amp;lsquo;Purifiers (or strainers, pavitra) are ye, and belonging to Vishṇu!&amp;rsquo; For Vishṇu is the sacrifice; so that he thereby says, &amp;lsquo;You belong to the sacrifice.&amp;rsquo; 02 Two there are of them: for means of cleansing (pavitra) is this (wind) which here ventilates (pavate); and this, it is true, ventilates as one only; but on entering into man, it becomes a forward and a backward one, and they are these two, to wit, the prāṇa (breathing out) and the udāna (breathing up or in) 2.</description>

      <description>01 He now takes the black antelope skin 1, for completeness of the sacrifice. For once upon a time the sacrifice escaped the gods, and having become a black antelope roamed about. The gods having thereupon found it and stripped it of its skin, they brought it (the skin) away with them. 02 Its white and black hairs represent the R̥c-verses and the Sāman-verses; to wit, the white the Sāman and the black the R̥c; or conversely, the black the Sāman and the white the R̥c.</description>

The reason why they are done simultaneously (is this): 02 The head of this sacrifice is (represented by) the rice-cake 1: for those potsherds (kapāla), no doubt, are to this (rice-cake) what the skull bones (kapāla) are to the head, and the ground rice is nothing else than the brain.</description>

      <description>01 When Indra hurled the thunderbolt at Vr̥tra, that hurled one became fourfold. Of (three parts of) it the wooden sword (sphya) represents one-third or thereabouts, the sacrificial post one-third or thereabouts, and the chariot one-third or thereabouts. That piece, moreover, with which he struck him, was broken off (śr̥); and on falling down it became an arrow (śara): hence the designation arrow, because it was broken off.

      <description>01 He (the Āgnīdhra) now brushes the spoons 1 (with the grass-ends). The reason why he brushes the spoons is that the course 2 pursued among the gods is in accordance with that pursued among men. Now, when the serving up of food is at hand among men,&amp;ndash;
02 They rinse the vessels, and having rinsed them, they serve up the food with them: in the same way is treated the sacrifice to the gods, that is to say, the cooked oblations and the prepared altar; and those vessels of theirs, the sacrificial spoons.</description>

      <description>01 Now the sacrifice is the man. The sacrifice is the man for the reason that the man spreads (performs) it; and that in being spread it is made of exactly the same extent as the man 1: this is the reason why the sacrifice is the man. 02 The juhū (spoon) further belongs to that (man-shaped sacrifice), and so does the upabhr̥t; and the dhruvā 2 represents its trunk. Now it is from the trunk that all these limbs proceed, and for this reason the entire sacrifice proceeds from the dhruvā.</description>

      <description>01 The Adhvaryu takes the sprinkling-water, and sprinkles in the first place the fire-wood 1, with the text (Vāj. S. II, 1), &amp;lsquo;A black deer, living in the den, art thou 2; I sprinkle thee, agreeable to Agni!&amp;rsquo; He thereby makes it sacrificially pure for Agni.
02 He then sprinkles he altar, with the text (Vāj. S. II, 1), &amp;lsquo;Thou art the altar; I sprinkle thee, agreeable to the barhis (sacrificial-grass covering)!</description>

      <description>01 They should be green (fresh); for that is (what constitutes) their living element, by that they are vigorous, by that possessed of strength: for this reason they should be green. 02 The middle stick he lays down first (on the west side of the fire), with the text (Vāj. S. II, 3), &amp;lsquo;May the Gandharva Viśvāvasu 1 lay thee around for the security of the All! Thou art a fence to the sacrificer, thou (art) Agni, invoked and worthy of invocation!</description>

      <description>01 He recites after uttering (the syllable) &amp;lsquo;Hiṅ!&amp;rsquo; Sacrifice, they say, is not (performed) without the Sāman; and neither is the Sāman chanted without &amp;lsquo;Hiṅ&amp;rsquo; having been uttered. By his uttering &amp;lsquo;Hiṅ!&amp;rsquo; the peculiar nature (rūpam) of the word &amp;lsquo;Hiṅ&amp;rsquo; is produced (in the sacrifice); and by the sacred syllable (om) it assumes the nature of the Sāman. By uttering &amp;lsquo;Om! Om 1!&amp;rsquo; this his entire sacrifice becomes endowed with the Sāman.</description>

S. II, 7 b), &amp;lsquo;Adoration to the gods!&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;Svadhā to the fathers!&amp;rsquo; Thereby he propitiates the gods and the fathers, now that he is about to perform the duties of the sacrificial priest.

      <description>01 He (the Adhvaryu) now utters his call for the Pravara (choosing of the Hotr̥) 1. The reason why he utters his call, is that the (Adhvaryu&amp;rsquo;s) call is the sacrifice: &amp;lsquo;having bespoke the sacrifice, I will choose the Hotr̥,&amp;rsquo; thus (he thinks, and) for this reason he utters his call for the Pravara.
02 He utters his call after taking the fuel-band; for if the Adhvaryu were to utter his call without taking hold of the sacrifice, he would either be unsteady or meet with some other ailment.</description>

      <description>01 The fore-offerings (prayāja), assuredly, are the seasons: hence there are five of them, for there are five seasons. 02 The gods and the Asuras, both of them sprang from Prajāpati, were once contending for this sacrifice, (which is) their father Prajāpati, the year: &amp;lsquo;Ours it (he) shall be!&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;Ours it (he) shall be!&amp;rsquo; they said. 03 Then the gods went on praising and toiling.

The Samidhs (kindlers), doubtless, are the breaths (vital airs), and he thereby kindles the breaths; for this man (the sacrificer) is kindled (animated) by his breaths: hence if he (the sacrificer) be burning (with fever, &amp;amp;c.), he (the Adhvaryu) will say, &amp;lsquo;Stroke (thyself)!&amp;rsquo; If he be hot, then one may feel confident, for then he is kindled; and if he be cold, then one need hope no longer.</description>

      <description>01 Tvashṭr̥ had a three-headed, six-eyed son. He had three mouths; and because he was thus shaped, his name was Viśvarūpa (&amp;lsquo;All-shape&amp;rsquo;). 02 One of his mouths was Soma-drinking, one spirit-drinking, and one for other kinds of food. Indra hated him and cut off those heads of his. 03 Now from the one which was Soma-drinking, a hazel-cock (francoline partridge) sprang forth; whence the latter is of brownish colour, for king Soma is brown.</description>

      <description>01 He (the Adhvaryu) drives the calves away (from the cows) with a parṇa branch 1. The reason why he drives the calves away with a parṇa branch is this. When the Gāyatrī flew towards Soma (the moon), a footless archer aiming at her while she was carrying him off, severed one of the feathers (parṇa) either of the Gāyatrī or of king Soma 2; and on falling down it became a parṇa (palāśa) tree; whence its name parṇa.</description>

02 This, assuredly, was a sin in the eyes of the gods. &amp;lsquo;He who acts thus towards his own daughter, our sister, [commits a sin],&amp;rsquo; they thought. 03 The gods then said to this god who rules over the beasts (Rudra) 2, &amp;lsquo;This one, surely, commits a sin who acts thus towards his own daughter, our sister.</description>

      <description>The normal performance of the Agnyādhāna, as that of the full and new-moon offerings, requires two days; the first of which is taken up with preliminary rites, while the second&amp;ndash;that is, the first day of the respective half-moon&amp;ndash;is devoted to the chief ceremonies, beginning with the production of the sacred fire by friction. (See II, 1, 4, 8 seq.)
After the sacrificer has chosen his four officiating priests&amp;ndash;viz. the Brahman, Hotr̥, Adhvaryu, and Āgnīdhra (or Agnīdh)&amp;ndash;he proceeds, together with them, to erect the two sheds or &amp;lsquo;firehouses.</description>

      <description>01 On the day preceding his Agnyādheya, he (the sacrificer with his wife) should take his food in the day-time. For the gods know the minds of man: they are, therefore, aware that his Agnyādheya is to take place on the morrow; and all the gods betake themselves to his house and stay (upa-vas) in his house; whence this day is called upavasatha (fast-day) 1. 02 Now, as it would be unbecoming for him to take food before men (who are staying with him as his guests) have eaten; how much more would it be so, if he were to take food before the gods have eaten: let him therefore take his food in the day-time.</description>

      <description>01 Now, in performing that sacrifice, they slay it; and in pressing out the king (Soma), they slay him; and in quieting and immolating the victim, they slay it. The haviryajña they slay with the mortar and pestle, and with the two mill-stones. 02 When slain, that sacrifice was no longer vigorous.

      <description>01 Verily, in him that exists 1, these deities reside, to wit, Indra, king Yama, Naḍa the Naishadha 2 (king), Anaśnat Sāṅgamana, and Asat Pāṁsava. 02 Now Indra, in truth, is the same as the Āhavanīya; and king Yama is the same as the Gārhapatya; and Naḍa Naishadha is the same as the Anvāhāryapacana (Dakshiṇa fire); and because day by day they take that (fire) to the south, therefore indeed they say that day by day Naḍa Naishadha carries king Yama 3 (further) south.</description>

      <description>01 Now when Prajāpati, in creating living beings, created Agni, the latter, as soon as born, sought to burn everything here: and so everybody tried to get out of his way 1. The creatures then existing sought to crush him. Being unable to endure this, he went to man. 02 He said, &amp;lsquo;I cannot endure this: come, let me enter into thee! Having reproduced me, maintain me; and as thou wilt reproduce and maintain me in this world, even so will I reproduce and maintain thee in yonder world!</description>

      <description>01 Once on a time the gods deposited with Agni all their beasts, both domestic and wild; either because they were about to engage in battle or from a desire of free scope, or because they thought that he (Agni) would protect them as the best protector. 02 Now Agni coveted them, and seizing them he entered the night with them. &amp;lsquo;Let us go back thither,&amp;rsquo; said the gods, and betook themselves to where Agni was concealed.</description>

      <description>01 Now it was by means of the Vaiśvadeva that Prajāpati produced living beings. The beings produced by him ate (ghas) Varuṇa&amp;rsquo;s barley corn; for originally the barley belonged to Varuṇa. And from their eating Varuṇa&amp;rsquo;s barley corn the name Varuṇapraghāsāḥ (is derived). 02 Varuṇa seized them; and on being seized by Varuṇa, they became rent all over 1; and they lay and sat them down breathing in and breathing out.</description>

And by means of the sacrifice to the fathers they then recalled to life those of them that had been slain in this battle; and they, indeed, were the fathers: hence the name Pitr̥yajña 1 (sacrifice to the Manes). 02 Now the spring, the summer, and the rainy season,&amp;ndash;they are those who vanquished (Vr̥tra); and the autumn, the winter, and the dewy season,&amp;ndash;they are those whom they (the gods) recalled to life 2.</description>

Now whichever of them were hit by (the Asuras’) arrows in that battle, those same darts they extracted, those they pulled out, by performing the Tryambaka-offerings. 02 And, accordingly, when he performs those offerings, he either does so hoping that thus no arrow (misfortune) will hit any of his, or because the gods did so.</description>

      <description>01 Verily, imperishable is the righteousness of him that offers the Seasonal sacrifices; for such a one gains the year, and hence there is no cessation for him. He gains it (the year) in three divisions, he conquers it in three divisions. The year means the whole, and the whole is imperishable (without end): hence his righteousness is indeed imperishable. Moreover, he thereby becomes a Season, and as such goes to the gods; but there is no perishableness in the gods, and hence there is imperishable righteousness for him.</description>

Moreover Agni is the lower half, and Vishṇu is the upper half of the sacrifice: &amp;lsquo;I will become consecrated after encompassing all the deities, after encompassing the entire sacrifice,&amp;rsquo; thus he thinks, and hence there is a cake on eleven potsherds for Agni and Vishṇu.</description>

      <description>01 All formulas of the consecration are audgrabhaṇa (elevatory), since he who is consecrated elevates himself (ud-grabh) from this world to the world of the gods. He elevates himself by means of these same formulas, and therefore they say that all formulas of the consecration are &amp;lsquo;audgrabhaṇa.&amp;rsquo; Now they also (specially) designate these intermediate ones as &amp;lsquo;audgrabhaṇa,&amp;rsquo; because these are libations 1, and a libation is a sacrifice. For the muttering of a sacrificial formula is an occult (form of sacrifice), but a libation is a direct (form of) sacrifice: hence it is by this same sacrifice that he elevates himself from this world to the world of the gods.</description>

And because all the gods sat (sad) in it, therefore it is called sadas: and so do these Brāhmans of every family now sit therein. By way of deity it belongs to Indra.
02 In the middle of it he puts up a (post) of udumbara wood (Ficus Glomerata); for the udumbara means strength and food; now the Sadas being his (Vishṇu&amp;rsquo;s belly), he thereby puts food therein; this is why he puts up an udumbara (post) in the middle of it.</description>

      <description>01 Verily, as large as the altar is, so large is the earth. The sacrificial stakes are thunderbolts; and by means of these thunderbolts he obtains possession of this earth, and excludes his enemies from sharing therein. Hence there are eleven stakes, and the twelfth lies aside rough-hewn; he puts it down south (of the altar). The reason why the twelfth lies aside is this. 02 Now the gods, while performing this sacrifice, were afraid of an attack from the Asura-Rakshas.</description>

      <description>01 There are both an animal and a sacrificial stake, for never do they immolate an animal without a stake. And as to why this is so:&amp;ndash;well, animals did not at first submit thereto that they should become food, as they are now become food; for just as man here walks two-footed and erect, so did they walk two-footed and erect. 02 Then the gods perceived that thunderbolt, to wit, the sacrificial stake; they raised it, and from fear thereof they (the animals) shrunk together and thus became four-footed, and thus became food, as they are now become food, for they submitted thereto: wherefore they immolate the animal only at a stake and never without a stake.</description>

      <description>01 Having made a noose, he throws it over (the victim) with (Vāj. S. VI, 8), &amp;lsquo;With the noose of sacred order I bind thee, O oblation to the gods!&amp;rsquo; for that rope, forsooth, is Varuṇa&amp;rsquo;s: therefore he thus binds it with the noose of sacred order, and thus that rope of Varuṇa does not injure it. 02 &amp;lsquo;Be bold, O man 1!&amp;rsquo; for at first man dared not 2 to approach it (the victim); but now that he thus binds it with the noose of sacred order, as an oblation to the gods, man dares to approach it: therefore he says, &amp;lsquo;Be bold, O man!</description>

      <description>01 Thereupon the Hotr̥, having sat down on the Hotr̥&amp;rsquo;s seat whereon he sits down after being chosen 1, urges, and thus urged the Adhvaryu takes the two spoons.
02 They then proceed with the Āprī (verses). The reason why they proceed with the Āprīs is this. With his whole mind, with his whole self, forsooth, he who consecrates himself prepares and endeavours to prepare the sacrifice. His self is, as it were, emptied out; with those Āprīs they fill it again; and because they fill 2 it therewith, therefore they are called Āprī.</description>

      <description>01 When he (the slaughterer) announces, &amp;lsquo;The victim has been quieted!&amp;rsquo; the Adhvaryu says, &amp;lsquo;Neshṭar, lead up the lady!&amp;rsquo; The Neshṭr̥ leads up the (sacrificer&amp;rsquo;s) wife bearing a vessel of water for washing the feet. 02 He makes her say (Vāg . S. VI, 12), &amp;lsquo;Homage be to thee, O wide-stretched!&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;the wide-stretched one, forsooth, is the sacrifice; for they stretch the sacrifice (over the sacrificial ground): hence the wide-stretched one is the sacrifice.</description>

      <description>01 For the same deity for which there is a victim, he subsequently prepares a sacrificial cake 1. The reason why he subsequently prepares a cake is this. Rice and barley, truly, are the sacrificial essence of all animals (victims) 2; with that same essence he now completes that (victim) and makes it whole. This is why he subsequently prepares a sacrificial cake. 02 And why he proceeds with that cake after performing (offering) with the omentum is this.</description>

      <description>01 Now there are three elevens at the animal offering,&amp;ndash;eleven fore-offerings, eleven after-offerings, and eleven by-offerings: ten fingers, ten toes, ten vital airs, and the out-breathing, in-breathing and through-breathing&amp;ndash;this much constitutes man, who is the highest of animals, after whom 1 are all animals. 02 Now they say,&amp;rsquo; What, then, is done at the sacrifice whereby the vital air is kindly to all the limbs?&amp;rsquo; 03 When he divides the hind-part into three portions,&amp;ndash;the hind-part being (an opening of the) vital air, and that (animal) extending from thence forward, that vital air pervades it all through.</description>

      <description>01 The Upāṁśu (graha), forsooth, is the out-breathing of the Sacrifice 1, the Upāṁśu-savana (press-stone) the through-breathing, and the Antaryāma (graha) the in-breathing. 02 Now as to why it is called Upāṁśu. There is a graha called Aṁśu 2, that is Prajāpati: his out-breathing is this (graha); and because it is his out-breathing, therefore it is called Upāṁśu. 03 This (graha) he draws without a strainer 3: whereby he puts the out-breathing into him as one tending away from him, and thus this forward-tending out-breathing of his streams forth from him.</description>

02 Now as to why it is called Antaryāma. That which is the out-breathing is also the in-breathing and the through-breathing. Now, in drawing the Upāṁśu (graha), he puts into him that out-breathing which tends away from him; and in drawing the Antaryāma, he puts into him that in-breathing which tends towards him.</description>

Now Indra, when he had hurled the thunderbolt at Vr̥tra, thinking himself to be the weaker, and fearing lest he had not laid him low, hid himself. The gods also hid themselves away in the same place. 02 The gods then said, &amp;lsquo;Verily, we know not if Vr̥tra be slain or alive: come, let one of us find out, if Vr̥tra be slain or alive!</description>

And, forsooth, Savitr̥ is his breath (vital air);&amp;ndash;when he draws the Upāṁśu cup, then he puts into him that vital air in front; and when he draws the Sāvitra cup, then he puts into him that vital air behind: thus those two vital airs on both sides are beneficial (or, put into him), both that which is above and that which is below.</description>

      <description>01 He proceeds with (the offering of) Soma&amp;rsquo;s rice-pap; for Soma is the sacrificial food of the gods; and here now sacrificial food is prepared for Soma on his part; and thus Soma is not excluded therefrom. It is a rice-pap (caru), for rice-pap is food for the gods, since rice-pap is boiled rice, and boiled rice is clearly food: therefore it is a rice-pap. 02 Neither at the morning feast, nor at the midday feast does he offer it, for those two press-feasts, the morning feast and the midday feast, are the exclusive feasts of the gods; and Soma is sacred to the Fathers 1.</description>

      <description>01 The metres, forsooth, are the (draught) cattle of the gods. Even as harnessed cattle here on earth draw for men, so do the harnessed metres draw the sacrifice for the gods. And whenever the metres gratified the gods, then the gods gratified the metres. Now it has been previous to this, that the harnessed metres have drawn the sacrifice to the gods, that they have gratified them 1:
02 He now draws the Hāriyojana 2 graha&amp;ndash;the Hāriyojana being the metres&amp;ndash;it is the metres he thereby gratifies: this is why he draws the Hāriyojana graha.</description>

      <description>01 Now, it is nine Samishṭayajus 1 he offers on this occasion. The reason why he offers nine Samishṭayajus is that those stotra-verses at the Bahishpavamāna 2 chant amount to nine. Thus there is at both ends an inferior (incomplete) virāj 3, for the sake of production: it was from that same inferior (lower) source of production on both sides that Prajāpati produced the creatures,&amp;ndash;from the one (he created) the upright, and from the other those tending to the ground.</description>

      <description>01 He now betakes himself to the expiatory bath (avabhr̥tha). The reason why he betakes himself to the expiatory bath is this. What vital sap there has been in him (Soma and the sacrificer), that (sap) of his he (the priest) has produced (extracted) for the offerings. Now that body (of Soma, i.e. the Soma-husks),&amp;ndash;there is no sap in it; (yet) it is not to be cast away: they take it down to the water and&amp;ndash;water being sap&amp;ndash;he puts that sap into it.</description>

      <description>01 He proceeds with the rice-pap to Aditi, as the concluding oblation. The reason why there is a rice-pap for Aditi is this. Because, on that former occasion 1, the gods said to her, &amp;lsquo;Thine forsooth shall be the opening, and thine the concluding oblation,&amp;rsquo; therefore he prepares that share for her at both ends (of the Soma-sacrifice). 02 And because, on that occasion, he offers when about to go forth (upa-pra-i) to buy the king (Soma), therefore that (opening oblation) is called Prāyaṇīya.</description>

      <description>01 If the Soma is carried off, let him say, &amp;lsquo;Run about and seek!&amp;rsquo; If they find it, why should they care? But if they do not find it, atonement is made therefore. 02 Now there are two kinds of Phālguna plants, the red-flowering and the brown-flowering. Those Phālguna plants which have brown flowers one may press; for they, the brown-flowering Phālgunas, are akin to the Soma-plant: therefore he may press those with brown flowers.</description>

02 Indra then bethought himself, &amp;lsquo;How can I stand forth over everything here, and how may everything here be beneath me?&amp;rsquo; He saw that graha, and drew it for himself. Then he stood forth over everything here, and everything here was beneath him.</description>

Now there is first that normal Tryaha (triduum), with settled metres 1: there he draws the cup beginning with the Aindravāyava. 02 Then, on the fourth day, he transposes the grahas, and they transpose the metres. There he draws the cups beginning with the Āgrayaṇa,&amp;ndash;for that fourth day is Prajāpati&amp;rsquo;s own; and the Āgrayaṇa is the self, and Prajāpati is the self: therefore he draws the cups beginning with the Āgrayaṇa.</description>

Hence when they draw that (cup) they produce that self of his. Therein they lay these vital airs, according to as these vital airs, the grahas, are explained 2; and verily the sacrificer is born with his whole body in yonder world.

Then the gods went on praising and toiling. They saw this Mahāvratīya (cup) and drew it for him: thereby they restored his joints.
02 With his joints thus restored, he approached this food, what food of Prajāpati there is,&amp;ndash;for what eating is to men, that the vrata (fast-food, or religious observance generally) is to the gods.</description>

      <description>01 At the Agnishṭoma (Sāman 1) he seizes a (victim) for Agni, for the Agnishṭoma (i.e. &amp;lsquo;Agni&amp;rsquo;s praise 2) is Agni: he thereby wins Agni. For the Ukthas 3 he seizes one for Indra and Agni; for the hymns (uktha) relate to Indra and Agni 4: the hymns he thereby wins. For the Shoḍaśi n he seizes one for Indra; for the Shoḍaśin is Indra: the Shoḍaśin (Indra) he thereby wins.</description>

      <description>01 At the midday Soma-feast he consecrates (the Sacrificer) by sprinkling; and at the midday Soma-feast they run a race; for, verily, Prajāpati is that sacrifice 1 which is here performed, and from which these creatures have been produced,&amp;ndash;and indeed, they are even now produced after this one: thus he thereby wins Prajāpati in the very centre (of the sacrifice). 02 The Māhendra cup being not yet drawn,&amp;ndash;for that, the Māhendra, is Indra&amp;rsquo;s special (nishkevalya) cup, and so also are his that Nishkevalya-stotra and Nishkevalya-śastra; and the Sacrificer is Indra: thus he consecrates him at his own dwelling-place.</description>

      <description>01 Now when they run a race, he thereby wins this same (terrestrial) world. And when the Brahman sings a Sāman on the cart-wheel set up on (a post) reaching to his navel, he thereby wins the air-world. And when he erects the sacrificial post, he thereby wins the world of the gods. Hence that threefold performance. 02 The Brahman mounts a cart-wheel, set up on (a post) as high as his navel 1, with (Vāj.</description>

He either offers those twelve āptis 1, or makes (the Sacrificer) pronounce (the formulas). Whether he offers, or makes him pronounce (the formulas), the significance is the same.
02 He offers, with (Vāj. S. IX, 20), &amp;lsquo;To the ally, hail!&amp;ndash;To the good ally, hail!&amp;ndash;To the after-born, hail!&amp;ndash;To the purpose, hail!&amp;ndash;To the Vasu, hail!</description>

Its svishṭakr̥t remains yet unoffered, when he (the Adhvaryu) brings 1 him (the Sacrificer) some food; for he who offers the Vājapeya wins food, vājapeya being the same as anna-peya: thus whatever food he (the Sacrificer) has thereby gained, that he (the Adhvaryu) now brings to him. 02 In a vessel of udumbara wood&amp;ndash;the Udumbara tree being sustenance, (that is) food&amp;ndash;for the obtainment of sustenance, food: therefore it is in a vessel of udumbara wood.</description>

He performs that Trishaṁyukta 1 offering. Therewith the gods came by men, and in like manner does this (king) now thereby come by men. 02 Now as to why there is that cake on eleven potsherds for Agni and Vishṇu;&amp;ndash;Agni is the giver, and men are Vishṇu&amp;rsquo;s: thus Agni, the giver, gives him (the king) men.</description>

And he, the commander, assuredly is one of his (the king&amp;rsquo;s) jewels 2: it is for him that he is thereby consecrated (or quickened), and him he makes his own faithful (follower).</description>

S. X, i), &amp;lsquo;The gods took honey-sweet water,&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;whereby he says, &amp;rsquo;the gods took water full of essence;&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;&amp;lsquo;sapful, deemed king-quickening,&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;by &amp;lsquo;sapful&amp;rsquo; he means to say, &amp;lsquo;full of essence;&amp;rsquo; and by &amp;lsquo;deemed king-quickening&amp;rsquo; he means to say, &amp;lsquo;(water) which is recognised as king-quickening;&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;&amp;lsquo;wherewith they anointed Mitra and Varuṇa,&amp;rsquo; for therewith they did anoint (sprinkle) Mitra and Varuṇa;&amp;ndash;&amp;lsquo;wherewith they guided Indra past his enemies,&amp;rsquo; for therewith they indeed guided Indra past the fiends, the Rakshas.</description>

      <description>01 North of the Āhavanīya he places a hundred, or more than a hundred, cows of that relative of his. The reason why he does so is this: 02 When Varuṇa was consecrated, his energy, his vigour departed from him. Probably 1 that collected essence (life-sap) of the waters wherewith they were sprinkling him, drove out his energy, his vigour. He found it in the cattle, and because he found it in them, therefore cattle are an object of respect.</description>

Whilst the Svishṭakr̥t of it remains yet unoffered, they bring a throne-seat for him (the king); for truly he who gains a seat in the air, gains a seat above (others): thus these subjects of his sit below him who is seated above,&amp;ndash;that is why they bring him a throne-seat. It is of khadira (acacia catechu) wood, and perforated, and bound with thongs as that of the Bhāratas.</description>

Of old, everything here was within Vr̥tra, to wit, the R̥c, the Yajus, and the Sāman.

He touched it: &amp;lsquo;May it grow! May it grow and multiply!&amp;rsquo; he said. 02 And the embryo which was inside was created as Vāyu (the wind).

From him, worn out and heated, the waters were created: from that heated Person the waters are born. 02 The waters said, &amp;lsquo;What is to become of us?&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;&amp;lsquo;Ye shall be heated,&amp;rsquo; he said.

When he slaughters that one, then indeed he reaches the end of Agni (the fire-altar).&amp;rsquo; 02 It is a dark grey one; for the grey has two kinds of hair, the white and the black; and two make a productive pair: that is its Prajāpati-characteristic. It is a hornless one, for Prajāpati is hornless.</description>

02 Agni said to him (Prajāpati), &amp;lsquo;I will step nigh!&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;&amp;lsquo;Wherewith?&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;&amp;lsquo;With cattle!&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;&amp;lsquo;So be it!&amp;rsquo; He thereby doubtless meant to say, &amp;lsquo;with the cattle-brick;&amp;rsquo; for that cattle-brick is the same as the dūrvā-brick 4: hence the dūrvā-brick is laid so as not to be separated from the first naturally-perforated one; hence also not separated from this earth are the plants, the cattle, the fire,&amp;ndash;for not separated (from the earth) 5 he (Agni) stepped nigh with this (brick).</description>

      <description>01 Those fires have been kindled (afresh); and they (the priests and sacrificer) betake themselves to the lump of clay 1;&amp;ndash;those fires doubtless are these worlds: when they are kindled, then they are these worlds. For formerly the gods were seeking this sacred rite outside of these worlds; and when he fetches the lump of clay after passing by those fires, he is seeking him (Agni) outside of these worlds. 02 They go eastwards; for the east is Agni&amp;rsquo;s region: he thus seeks him in his own region, finds him in his own region.</description>

And, moreover, whilst standing one is strongest. 02 Standing (with his face) towards north-east, for standing towards north-east Prajāpati created creatures. 03 And, again, why (he does so) standing towards north-east;&amp;ndash;that (quarter), the north-east, is the quarter of both gods and men. 04 And, again, why standing towards north-east,&amp;ndash;in that quarter is the gate of the world of heaven, hence it is standing with his face towards northeast that one offers libations, and standing towards north-east that one leads up the dakshiṇās: it is by the gate that he thus makes him enter into the world of heaven.</description>

When Prajāpati performed the first offering, a vikaṅkata tree sprang forth from that place where, after offering, he cleansed (his hands). That vikaṅkata, then, is that first offering; it is that he now offers on this (fire), and he therewith gratifies him (Agni). [Vāj. S. XI, 71; R̥k S.

For at that (former) time he regales him (Agni) with that food, those kindling-sticks; and the foul part of that eaten food sinks to the bottom as ashes. He now clears him thereof, and infuses speech into him 2, thus freed from foulness.</description>

Now the gods at that time were desiring, &amp;lsquo;May we be like Parjanya (the rain-god)!&amp;rsquo; By that body (of his 1) they became like Parjanya, and in like manner does the Sacrificer by that body (of his) become like Parjanya. 02 [Vāj.

The gods drove about on wheels (cars), and the Asuras stayed at home. The gods, while driving about on wheels, saw 1 this rite (sacrificial performance), for it was indeed in driving about on wheels that they saw this rite: hence it is to the cart that the formulas relate at the (performance with) sacrificial cakes 2, and to the cart in the building of the fire-altar 3.</description>

From him, when relaxed, the vital air went out from within: then his vigour went out of him. That having gone out, he fell down.

      <description>01 Having smoothed (the sand) down with the two verses containing (the verb) &amp;rsquo;to grow,&amp;rsquo; and returned (to the hall) he proceeds with the guest offering. Having performed the guest offering, he proceeds with the Pravargya and the Upasad 1. Having performed the Pravargya and the Upasad, they appease that (first) layer on the (red ox-)skin. And as to why on a skin: for the obtainment of the forms, the skin being outward form;&amp;ndash;on the hairy side: for the obtainment of the forms, hair being outward form;&amp;ndash;on a ruddy (skin): for the obtainment of all forms, all forms (colours being contained) in the ruddy;&amp;ndash;on (the skin) of an ox: for the obtainment of Agni&amp;rsquo;s forms, the ox being the same as Agni;&amp;ndash;on (the skin spread) with the neck towards the east, for that (tends) godward.</description>

      <description>01 He puts a Svayam-ātr̥ṇṇā (naturally-perforated brick) on (the gold man);&amp;ndash;the (first) naturally-perforated one being this earth, he thus puts this earth thereon. He puts it on so as not to be separate from the man; for the naturally-perforated one means food, and the naturally-perforated one means this earth, and this earth is food, since it is on her that all food ripens: he thus places food close to him (the man, Agni).</description>

      <description>01 He then puts down a (living) tortoise;&amp;ndash;the tortoise means life-sap: it is life-sap (blood) he thus bestows on (Agni). This tortoise is that life-sap of these worlds which flowed away from them when plunged into the waters 1: that (life-sap) he now bestows on (Agni). As far as the life-sap extends, so far the body extends: that (tortoise) thus is these worlds. 02 That lower shell of it is this (terrestrial) world; it is, as it were, fixed; for fixed, as it were, is this (earth-)world.</description>

      <description>01 He puts the heads of the victims in (the fire-pan),&amp;ndash;the heads of the victims being animals (or cattle), it is animals he thus puts thereon. He puts them in the fire-pan;&amp;ndash;the pan being these worlds, and the heads of the victims being beasts, he thus puts animals in these worlds; whence there are animals in these worlds.
02 And as to why (he puts the heads) in the fire-pan;&amp;ndash;the fire-pan being a womb, and the heads of the victims being animals, he thus establishes the animals in the womb: hence animals, though being eaten and cooked, do not diminish, for he establishes them in the womb.</description>

XIII, 56), &amp;lsquo;This one behind, the all-embracer;&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;the all-embracer, doubtless, is yonder sun, for as soon as 1 he rises, all this embracing space comes into existence.

The Sun, indeed, having become the eye, remained behind: it is that form he now bestows (on Agni).</description>

      <description>01 As to this they say, &amp;lsquo;What are the vital airs (prāṇa), and what the Prāṇabhr̥taḥ?&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;The vital airs are just the vital airs, and the Prāṇabhr̥taḥ (holders of the vital airs) are the limbs, for the limbs do hold the vital airs. But, indeed, the vital airs are the vital airs, and the Prāṇabhr̥t is food, for food does uphold the vital airs. 02 As to this they say, &amp;lsquo;How do all these (Prāṇabhr̥t-bricks) of him (Agni and the Sacrificer) come to be of Prajāpati&amp;rsquo;s nature?</description>

      <description>01 Now some lay down (these bricks) so as to be in contact with the (gold) man, for he is the vital air, and him these (bricks) sustain; and because they sustain (bhr̥) the vital air (prāṇa), therefore they are called &amp;lsquo;Prāṇabhr̥taḥ.&amp;rsquo; Let him not do so: the vital air is indeed the same as that gold man, but this body of his extends to as far here as this fire (altar) has been marked out.</description>

      <description>01 He then lays down the Vaiśvadevī (All-gods’ bricks). For this second layer is that one which the Aśvins at that time laid down for them (the gods); and by laying it down they became everything here whatsoever there is here. 02 The gods spake, &amp;lsquo;The Aśvins have become everything here: think ye upon this as to how we also may share in it!&amp;rsquo; They said, &amp;lsquo;Meditate ye (cit)!&amp;rsquo; whereby, no doubt, they meant to say, Seek ye a layer (citi)!</description>

      <description>01 He then lays down a Viśvajyotis (all-light brick). Now the middle Viśvajyotis is Vāyu 1, for Vāyu (the wind) is all the light in the air-world: it is Vāyu he thus places therein. He places it so as not to be separated from the regional (bricks): he thus places Vāyu in the regions, and hence there is wind in all the regions. 02 And, again, as to why he lays down the Viśvajyotis,&amp;ndash;the Viśvajyotis, doubtless, is offspring (or creatures), for offspring indeed is all the light: he thus lays generative power (into that world).</description>

In this (layer) that whole fire-altar becomes completed, and therein these (bricks are) the firmament (nāka), the world of heaven: it is therein that the gods seated themselves; and inasmuch as the gods seated themselves on that firmament, in the world of heaven, the gods are the firmament-seated.

      <description>01 He lays down two Ritavyā (seasonal bricks). The seasonal (bricks) are the same as these seasons: it is the seasons he thereby lays down. And, indeed, the seasonal ones are everything here, for the seasonal ones are the year, and the year is everything here: he thus lays down everything here. And generative power they also are,&amp;ndash;for the seasonal ones are the year, and the year means generative power: it is generative power he thus lays down (or bestows on Agni and the Sacrificer).</description>

      <description>01 He then lays down a Lokampr̥ṇā 1 (space-filling brick); the Lokampr̥ṇā, doubtless, is yonder sun, for he fills these worlds: it is thus yonder sun he thereby sets up. He lays down this (Lokampr̥ṇā) in all the (five) layers, for those layers are these (three) worlds 2: he thus places the sun in (all) these worlds, whence he shines for all these worlds.
02 And, again, as to why he lays down a Lokampr̥ṇā,&amp;ndash;the Lokampr̥ṇā, doubtless, is the nobility (or chieftaincy) 3, and these other bricks are the peasants (or clansmen): he thus places the nobility (or chieftain), as the eater, among the peasantry.</description>

      <description>01 He now throws loose soil (on the layer); for the loose soil means flesh: he thus covers him (Agni) with flesh. [He does so] after having laid down the bricks;&amp;ndash;the bricks are the bone: he thus covers the bone with flesh. 02 He also strews it on (the place where lies) the naturally-perforated (brick), for the naturally-perforated one means vital air, and the loose soil means food: he thus puts food into (the channels of) the vital air.</description>

      <description>01 On the (three) naturally-perforated (bricks) he (the Sacrificer) sings sāmans; for the naturally-perforated ones are these (three) worlds; and they are just these (ordinary) stones. The gods, having laid them down, saw them as such: that they were dry stones.
02 They spake, &amp;lsquo;Think ye upon this, how we may lay sap, the means of subsistence, into these worlds!&amp;rsquo; They spake, &amp;lsquo;Meditate ye!&amp;rsquo; whereby, doubtless, they meant to say, &amp;lsquo;Seek ye a layer!</description>

For the gods, having now appeased him by the Śatarudriya, thereby appeased him still further; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer), now that he has appeased him by the Śatarudriya, still further appease him thereby. 02 With water he sprinkles him 1,&amp;ndash;water is a means of appeasing (soothing): he thus appeases him thereby.

      <description>01 Thereupon 1 he (the Sacrificer 2) offers the Vasor dhārā.

      <description>01 Prajāpati was desirous of gaining these worlds. He saw this bird-like body, the Fire-altar: he fashioned it, and thereby gained this (terrestrial) world. He saw a second bird-like body, the (chant of the) Great Rite 1: he fashioned it, and thereby gained the air. He saw a third bird-like body, the Great Litany 1: he fashioned it, and thereby gained the sky.
02 This built Fire-altar, doubtless, is this (terrestrial) world, the Great Rite the air, and the Great Litany the sky: all these, the Fire-altar, the Great Rite, and the Great Litany, one ought therefore to undertake together, for these worlds were created together; and as to why the Fire-altar is built first, it is because of these worlds this (terrestrial) one was created first.</description>

He saw this bird-like body, the fire-altar, and constructed it. He attempted to fly up, without contracting and expanding (the wings), but could not do so.

For at that time the gods were afraid lest the fiends, the Rakshas, should destroy that (Agni&amp;rsquo;s body) of theirs (built) there 2.

The days and nights of a month are sixty, and in the month, doubtless, the days and nights of the year are obtained; and there are twenty-four half-months, thirteen months, and three seasons (of four months)&amp;ndash;that makes a hundred parts, and the year itself is the one hundred and first part.</description>

      <description>01 The Gāyatrī is the breath (of Prajāpati, the altar), the Ushṇih the eye, the Anushṭubh the voice, the Br̥hatī the mind, the Paṅkti the ear; the Trishṭubh is that generative breath; and the Jagatī that downward breathing;&amp;ndash;these are the seven metres increasing by four (syllables) each 1, which are produced in Agni (the fire-altar).
02 &amp;lsquo;The Gāyatrī is the breath,&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;thus, whatever power, whatever vigour there is in the breath that is this one thousand; and to the breath, indeed, this vigour belongs; for were the breath of him who builds it to pass away, this fire-altar, assuredly, would not be built: by this its form that (altar) becomes built (so as to contain) a thousand Gāyatrīs.</description>

      <description>01 Now, the Yajus, indeed, is he who blows here, for even whilst passing along he (Vāyu, the wind) generates (vivifies) everything here, and after him passing along everything is generated: this is why the Yajus is no other than Vāyu. 02 And the course 1 (jūḥ) is this space, to wit, this air 2, for along this space it (the wind) courses; and the Yajus is both the wind and the air&amp;ndash;the &amp;lsquo;yat&amp;rsquo; and the &amp;lsquo;jūḥ&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;whence (the name) Yajus.</description>

      <description>01 When the gods restored the relaxed Prajāpati, they poured him, as seed, into the fire-pan (ukhā) as the womb, for the fire-pan is a womb In the course of a year they prepared for him this food, to wit, the fire-altar built here, and enclosed it in a body; and, being enclosed in a body, it became the body itself; whence food, when enclosed in a body, becomes the body itself.</description>

He himself, indeed, proclaimed (taught) his own self to Yajñavacas Rājastambāyana, saying, &amp;lsquo;As many lights as there are of mine, so many are my bricks.&amp;rsquo; 02 Now in this Prajāpati, the year, there are seven hundred and twenty days and nights, his lights, (being) those bricks; three hundred and sixty enclosing-stones 1, and three hundred and sixty bricks with (special) formulas.</description>

      <description>01 When Prajāpati was creating living beings, Death, that evil, overpowered him. He practised austerities for a thousand years, striving to leave evil behind him. 02 Whilst he was practising austerities, lights went upwards from those hair-pits 1 of his; and those lights are those stars: as many stars as there are, so many hair-pits there are; and as many hair-pits as there are, so many muhūrtas there are in a (sacrificial performance) of a thousand years.</description>

      <description>01 Now the doctrines of mystic imports 1. The Śākāyanins hold that &amp;lsquo;Agni is Vāyu (the wind);&amp;rsquo; but some say that &amp;lsquo;Agni is Āditya (the sun).&amp;rsquo; And either Śraumatya, or Hāliṅgava, said, &amp;lsquo;Agni is no other than Vāyu: wherefore the Adhvaryu, when he performs the last work 2, passes into that (wind).&amp;rsquo; 02 And Śāṭyāyani said, &amp;lsquo;Agni is no other than the Year; his head is the spring, his right wing the summer, his left wing the rainy season, his middle body (trunk) the autumn season, and his tail and feet the winter and dewy seasons&amp;ndash;Agni is speech, Vāyu breath, the sun the eye, the moon the mind, the quarters the ear, the generative power water 3, the feet (and tail) fervour, the joints the months, the veins the half-moons, the silver and gold feathers the days and nights: thus he passes over to the gods.</description>

      <description>01 The mystic import of this Fire-altar, doubtless, is Speech; for it is with speech that it is built: with the R̥c, the Yajus and the Sāman as the divine (speech); and when he (the Adhvaryu) speaks with human speech, &amp;lsquo;Do ye this! do ye that!&amp;rsquo; then also it (the altar) is built therewith. 02 Now, this speech is threefold&amp;ndash;the R̥k-verses, the Yajus-formulas, and the Sāman-tunes;&amp;ndash;thereby the Fire-altar is threefold, inasmuch as it is built with that triad.</description>

      <description>01 Now when they spread (and perform) the sacrifice, they kill it; and when they press out king Soma, they kill him; and when they &amp;lsquo;quiet&amp;rsquo; and cut up the victim, they kill it,&amp;ndash;it is by means of the mortar and pestle, and by the two mill-stones that they kill the Haviryajña (grain-offering). 02 And having killed the sacrifice, he pours it, as seed, into the fire as its womb, for, indeed, the fire is the womb of the sacrifice, from out of it it is produced: let him therefore perform those ten oblations 1 for which the Vashaṭ is uttered.</description>

      <description>01 When he has performed the Full-moon sacrifice, he prepares an additional (cake) for Indra Vimr̥dh (the repeller of scorners), and offers it in accordance with the procedure of an ishṭi 1; and when he has performed the New-moon sacrifice, he prepares an additional rice-pap for Aditi 2, and offers it in accordance with the procedure of an ishṭi. 02 And as to why, after performing the Full-moon sacrifice, he prepares (a cake) for Indra Vimr̥dh, it is because Indra is the deity of the sacrifice; but the chief oblation of the Full-moon sacrifice belongs to Agni and Soma, and nothing is offered there with the formula &amp;lsquo;To Indra (I offer) thee!</description>

      <description>01 Now, some people enter upon the fast 1 when they (still) see (the moon, on the fourteenth day of the half-month), thinking, &amp;lsquo;To-morrow he will not rise,&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;either on account of clouds or not having ascertained properly, they enter upon the fast, and (in the morning) he rises over him. Now if he (the moon) should rise on (the material for) the oblation being not yet taken out, then that approved (procedure is followed) and the same fasting-observance.</description>

But, indeed, he (the moon) is that heavenly dog: he watches the Sacrificer&amp;rsquo;s cattle (to seize them), and that would not be good for cattle if amends were not made to them 2; and through fear of that &amp;lsquo;down-coming moon 3,&amp;rsquo; as they think him to be,&amp;ndash;</description>

      <description>01 Verily, in the beginning this (universe) was water, nothing but a sea of water. The waters desired, &amp;lsquo;How can we be reproduced?&amp;rsquo; They toiled and performed fervid devotions 1, when they were becoming heated, a golden egg was produced. The year, indeed, was not then in existence: this golden egg floated about for as long as the space of a year. 02 In a year&amp;rsquo;s time a man, this Prajāpati, was produced therefrom; and hence a woman, a cow, or a mare brings forth within the space of a year; for Prajāpati was born in a year.</description>

      <description>01 Now there, on the occasion of the entering on the fast, it is said 1, &amp;lsquo;If he does not eat, he becomes consecrated to the Fathers 2; and if he does eat he eats whilst passing over the gods;&amp;rsquo; and, in this respect, they lay down the rule, &amp;lsquo;Let him therefore eat what grows in the forest.&amp;rsquo;
02 If he eats cultivated plants he eats the sacrificial essence of the offering-cake; and if he eats forest plants he eats the essence of the barhis 3; and if he eats aught of trees he eats the essence of the fuel (for the sacrificial fire); and if he drinks milk he consumes the essence of the Sānnāyya 4; and if he drinks water he consumes the essence of the lustral waters 5; and if he eats nothing he becomes consecrated to the Fathers.</description>

      <description>01 Now, the gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Prajāpati, once strove together. Then the Asuras, even through arrogance, thinking, &amp;lsquo;Unto whom, forsooth, should we make offering?&amp;rsquo; went on offering into their own mouths. They came to naught, even through arrogance: wherefore let no one be arrogant, for verily arrogance is the cause of ruin 1. 02 But the gods went on offering unto one another. Prajāpati gave himself up to them, and the sacrifice became theirs; for, indeed, the sacrifice is the food of the gods.</description>

      <description>01 Verily, man is born thrice, namely in this way:&amp;ndash;first he is born from his mother and father; and when he to whom the sacrifice inclines performs offering he is born a second time; and when he dies, and they place him on the fire, and when he thereupon comes into existence again, he is born a third time;&amp;ndash;wherefore they say, &amp;lsquo;Man is born thrice.&amp;rsquo;
02 He (the Hotr̥) recites those eleven kindling-verses 1,&amp;ndash;there are these ten vital airs in man, and the body in which these vital airs are established is the eleventh,&amp;ndash;so great, indeed, is man: he thus causes him to be born complete.</description>

He desired, &amp;lsquo;May I exist, may I be generated.&amp;rsquo; He wearied himself and performed fervid devotions: from him, thus wearied and heated, the three worlds were created&amp;ndash;the earth, the air, and the sky. 02 He heated these three worlds, and from them, thus heated, three lights (jyotis) were produced&amp;ndash;Agni (the fire), he who blows here (Vāyu), and Sūrya (the sun). 03 He heated these three lights, and from them, thus heated, the three Vedas were produced&amp;ndash;the R̥g-veda from Agni, the Yajur-veda from Vāyu, and the Sāma-veda from Sūrya.</description>

      <description>01 Now, Bhr̥gu, the son of Varuṇa, deemed himself superior to his father Varuṇa in knowledge 1. Varuṇa became aware of this: &amp;lsquo;He deems himself superior to me in knowledge,&amp;rsquo; he thought. 02 He said, &amp;lsquo;Go thou eastward, my boy; and having seen there what thou shalt see, go thou southwards; and having seen there what thou shalt see, go thou westward; and having seen there what thou shalt see, go thou northward; and having seen there what thou shalt see, go thou toward the northern of those two intermediate quarters in front 2, and tell me then what thou shalt see there.</description>

      <description>01 Now, Janaka of Videha once met some Brāhmaṇas who were travelling about 1, to wit, Śvetaketu Āruṇeya, Somaśushma Sātyayajñi, and Yājñavalkya. He said to them, &amp;lsquo;How do ye each of you perform the Agnihotra?&amp;rsquo; 02 Śvetaketu Āruṇeya replied, &amp;lsquo;O great king, I make offering, in one another, to two heats, never-failing and overflowing with glory.&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;&amp;lsquo;How is that?&amp;rsquo; asked the king.&amp;ndash;&amp;lsquo;Well, Āditya (the sun) is heat: to him I make offering in Agni in the evening; and Agni, indeed, is heat: to him I make offering in the morning in Āditya 2.</description>

      <description>01 Janaka of Videha performed a sacrifice accompanied with numerous gifts to the priests. Setting apart a thousand cows, he said, &amp;lsquo;He who is the most learned in sacred writ amongst you, O Brāhmaṇas, shall drive away these (cows) 1!&amp;rsquo; 02 Yājñavalkya then said, &amp;lsquo;This way (drive) them!&amp;rsquo; They said, &amp;lsquo;Art thou really the most learned in sacred writ amongst us, Yājñavalkya?&amp;rsquo; He replied, &amp;lsquo;Reverence be to him who is most learned in sacred writ!</description>

      <description>01 Now there is one animal sacrifice of the Haviryajña order 1, and another of the order of the Soma-sacrifice. Of the Haviryajña order is that at which he (the Adhvaryu) brings him fast-food 2, leads water forward 3, and pours out a jarful of water 4, and at which (the Sacrificer) strides the Vishṇu-strides 5; and of the order of the Soma-sacrifice is that (animal sacrifice) at which these (rites) are not performed.</description>

      <description>01 Such a (sacrificial stake) as has much substance 1 is not auspicious to cattle, whence he who desires to have cattle should not make such a one his sacrificial stake: but such a one as is of little hardness is auspicious to cattle, whence he who desires to have cattle should make such a one his sacrificial stake. 02 And such a one as, while being crooked, has a top like a spit, is called &amp;lsquo;kapotī 2&amp;rsquo;; and whoever makes such a one his sacrificial stake certainly goes to yonder world before his full measure of life: therefore let no one wishing for long life make such a one his sacrificial stake.</description>

      <description>01 Now, when he who is about to perform an animal sacrifice makes a stake one cubit long, he thereby gains this (terrestrial) world; and when (he makes) one two cubits long, he thereby gains the air-world; and when be makes one three cubits long, he thereby gains the heavens; and when he makes one four cubits long, he thereby gains the regions. But, indeed, that sacrificial stake of the (ordinary) animal sacrifice is either three or four cubits long, and one that is above that belongs to the Soma-sacrifice.</description>

Now, that which is laid down is this very (terrestrial) world; that which is taken out is the air-world, that which is taken forward is the sky, and that which is spread is the regions.

      <description>01 The gods were once performing the initiation ceremony for a (sacrificial session) of a thousand years. When five hundred years had passed with them, everything here was worn out&amp;ndash;to wit, Stomas, and Pr̥shṭḥas, and metres (texts). 02 The gods then perceived that unexhausted element of the sacrifice, and by means of that unexhausted element they obtained what success there was in the Veda; and, verily, for him who thus knows this, the Vedas are unexhausted, and the work of the officiating priests is pet-formed with the unexhausted threefold science.</description>

      <description>01 Of old, indeed, they were wont to seize this victim as one dedicated to Savitr̥, but now they seize it as one dedicated to Prajāpati, saying, &amp;lsquo;Savitr̥, in truth, is the same as Prajāpati.&amp;rsquo; It is therefore after having thrown together the (sacrificial) fires that they ought to perform this (animal) sacrifice on the Gr̥hapati&amp;rsquo;s own fires, thinking, &amp;lsquo;May we also have a share in this tail (of the. victim) wherewith they are now making offering together to the wives (of the gods).</description>

      <description>01 And, in the morning, having taken out the ashes, and smeared (the fire-places) with cow-dung, he lifts the two fires on the churning-sticks, and returns (to the offering-ground). Having then churned out the Gārhapatya, taken out the Āhavanīya, and brought the Anvāhārya-pacana (to the southern hearth), he should prepare a cake on eight potsherds to Agni Pathikr̥t (the path-maker). The course of procedure thereof (is as follows):&amp;ndash;he should recite those same seventeen kindling-verses; the two butter-portions relate to the slaying of Vr̥tra 1; the saṁyājyās are two Virāj verses 1; and the invitatory and offering formulas are as follows:&amp;ndash;(the anuvākyā, R̥g-veda VI, 16, 3), &amp;lsquo;For thou, most wise Agni, divine disposer, readily knowest the ways and paths at sacrifices;&amp;rsquo; and the yājyā (R̥g-veda X, 2, 3), &amp;lsquo;We have entered upon the path of the gods to carry on what we can do: the wise Agni shall sacrifice, he shall be the priest, he shall order the sacrifices and their seasons;&amp;rsquo; for Agni is the path-maker, the guide of paths: he, verily, guides him upon the path of sacrifice.</description>

      <description>01 Prajāpati created the (Soma-)sacrifice. He took it and performed it. When he had performed it, he felt like one emptied out. He saw this sacrificial performance, the Sautrāmaṇī, and performed it, and then he was again replenished; and, indeed, he who performs the Soma-sacrifice is, as it were, emptied out, for his wealth, his prosperity is, as it were, taken from him. 02 Having performed a Soma-sacrifice one ought to perform the Sautrāmaṇī: as a cow that has been milked would replenish again, even so, indeed, does he replenish himself,&amp;ndash;he replenishes himself by offspring and cattle; and, verily, he who, knowing this, performs the Sautrāmaṇī, or he who (even) knows this, establishes himself in this world, and wins the heavenly world.</description>

Indra, committing a desecration of the sacrifice, by main force drank off his (Tvashṭr̥&amp;rsquo;s) Soma juice.

      <description>01 Prajāpati desired, &amp;lsquo;Would that I were great, and more numerous!&amp;rsquo; He perceived those two Mahiman (greatness) cups of Soma at the Aśvamedha; he offered them; and thereby, indeed, became great and more numerous: hence whosoever should desire to become great, and more numerous, let him offer up those two Mahiman cups of Soma at the Aśvamedha; and he indeed becomes great and more numerous. 02 He offers them on both sides (before and after) the omentum;&amp;ndash;the Aśvamedha, doubtless, is the Sacrificer, and that Mahiman (cup) is the king: it is with royal dignity he thus encompasses him on both sides.</description>

      <description>01 Now, the gods did not know the Pavamāna 1 at the Aśvamedha to be the heavenly world, but the horse knew it. When, at the Aśvamedha, they glide along 2 with the horse for the Pavamāna (-stotra), it is for getting to know (the way to) the heavenly world; and they hold on to the horse&amp;rsquo;s tail, in order to reach the heavenly world; for man does not rightly know (the way to) the heavenly world, but the horse does rightly know it</description>

      <description>01 Prajāpati desired, &amp;lsquo;Would that I might gain both worlds, the world of the gods, and the world of men.&amp;rsquo; He saw those beasts, the tame and the wild ones; he seized them, and by means of them took possession of these two worlds: by means of the tame beasts he took possession of this (terrestrial) world, and by means of the wild beasts of yonder (world); for this world is the world of men, and yonder world is the world of the gods.</description>

      <description>01 Prajāpati poured forth the life-sap of the horse (aśva-medha); when poured forth it went from him. Having become fivefold 1 it entered the year, and they (the five parts) became those half-months 2. He followed it up by means of the fifteenfold (sets of victims 3), and found it; and having found it, he took possession of it by means of the fifteenfold ones; for, indeed, they&amp;ndash;to wit, the fifteenfold (sets)&amp;ndash;are a symbol of the half-months, and when he seizes the fifteenfold ones, it is the half-months the Sacrificer thereby takes possession of.</description>

By means of the Aśvamedha the gods restored it to its place; and verily he who performs the Aśvamedha makes Prajāpati complete, and he (himself) becomes complete; and this, indeed, is the atonement for everything, the remedy for everything. Thereby the gods redeem all sin, yea, even the slaying of a Brahman 1 they thereby redeem; and he who performs the Aśvamedha redeems all sin, he redeems the slaying of a Brahman.</description>

02 He then pours out that (jarful of bones 4); for this earth is the foundation: on this (earth), as a foundation, he thus establishes him.</description>

      <description>01 They now fix pegs round it 1,&amp;ndash;a Palāśa (Butea frondosa) one in front,&amp;ndash;for the Palāśa is the Brahman (n.): he thus makes him go to the heavenly world with the Brahman for his leader;&amp;ndash;a Śamī (Prosopis spicigera) one on the left (north corner), in order that there may be peace (śam) for him;&amp;ndash;a Varaṇa (Crataeva Roxburghii) one behind, in order that he may ward off (vāraya) sin from him;&amp;ndash; and a Vr̥tra-peg 2 on the right (south corner) for sin not to pass beyond.</description>

      <description>01 Now at the time when he there 1 proceeds with the guest-meal, he who intends to perform the Pravargya, prior to the Upasads 2, spreads Kuśa grass with its tops directed towards the east, in front of the Gārhapatya, and places the vessels thereon in pairs 3,&amp;ndash;the Upayamanī (tray) and the Mahāvīra (pot), the pair of lifting-sticks 4, the two milking-bowls, the two Rauhiṇa-plates, the two offering spoons for the Rauhiṇa (cakes), and whatever other (implement) there is,&amp;ndash;these make ten, for the Virāj consists of ten syllables, and the sacrifice is Virāj: he thus makes this to be equal to the Virāj, the sacrifice.</description>

      <description>01 Now, when the Adhvaryu here steps up and says, &amp;lsquo;The Gharma is aglow,&amp;rsquo; they step up and revere it (the Mahāvīra) with the Avakāśa 1; but the &amp;lsquo;avakāśa&amp;rsquo; are the vital airs: it is thus the vital airs he lays into it. Six of them 2 step up to it, for six in number are these vital airs in the head: it is these he thus lays into it. 02 [Vāj.</description>

      <description>01 And when the Hotr̥ recites this (verse), &amp;lsquo;Let Brahmaṇaspati go forward, let the goddess Sūnr̥tā go forward,&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;the Adhvaryu, stepping forward, makes offering (by muttering) the wind-names. For at this time the gods were afraid lest the Rakshas, the fiends, might injure that (Pravargya) of theirs in the middle (of the sacrifice): they offered it with the Svāhā-call before (its being taken to) the Āhavanīya, being thus offered they offered it (again) in the fire; and in like manner does this one now offer it with the Svāhā-call before (its being taken to) the Āhavanīya, and being thus offered he offers it (again) in the fire.</description>

      <description>01 Verily, in the beginning, Prajāpati alone existed here 1. He thought within himself, &amp;lsquo;How can I be propagated?&amp;rsquo; He toiled and practised austerities. He created living beings 2. The living beings created by him passed away: they are those birds. Now man is the nearest to Prajāpati; and man is two-footed: hence birds are two-footed. 02 Prajāpati thought within himself, &amp;lsquo;Even as formerly I was alone, so also am I now alone.</description>
