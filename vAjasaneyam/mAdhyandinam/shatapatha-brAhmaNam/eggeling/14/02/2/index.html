<p>483:1 The exact meaning of &lsquo;hārdvānam&rsquo; is doubtful.

Dict. takes the word to be &lsquo;hārd-van,&rsquo; in the sense of &lsquo;herzstärkend&rsquo; (heart-sustaining, invigorating&ndash;? literally, &lsquo;possessed of heartiness&rsquo;). The Taitt. Ār. has &lsquo;hārdivānam&rsquo; instead. The author of the Brāhmaṇa apparently considers the term as obscure, and uses this circumstance for his own symbolic purposes.&#160;<a href="#fnref:7" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

Mahīdhara takes it to mean &lsquo;relating to morning and evening,&rsquo; as applying to the two performances of the Pravargya,&#160;<a href="#fnref:8" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

Possibly, however, he is to do so at the time when the pot bubbles over (though the &lsquo;atha&rsquo; would rather be out of place in that case). The Taittirīyas differ somewhat on this point of the performance.  After the Gharma-milk has been offered, the Pratiprasthātr̥ fills the Mahāvīra pot, whilst it is held over the fire, with boiled sour curds and whey (dadhi), whilst muttering the text, &lsquo;The Aśvins drank the Gharma . . .,&rsquo; and with the texts; &lsquo;For freshness swell thou,&rsquo; &amp;c.&#160;<a href="#fnref:10" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

Mahīdhara takes it in the sense of &lsquo;having their barhis pointed upwards,&rsquo; i.e. towards the east (!), the peculiar feature of the barhis in the present case&ndash;as far as the participation of the Fathers in the drinking of the Gharma is concerned&ndash;being its having the tops of the grass-stalks turned to the east instead of to the south, as is the case in all ceremonies relating to the Fathers. The term &lsquo;ūrdhvabarhis&rsquo; might possibly mean &lsquo;having their (special) barhis above,&rsquo; i.e. in the world of the Fathers, where they would be supposed to partake of the libations of hot milk; whilst yet another (suggested by the next paragraph) would be that of &lsquo;having the barhis above them;&rsquo; which would, however, be more appropriate if the secreting of the stick under the barhis applied to the present, instead of the next one.&#160;<a href="#fnref:15" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
