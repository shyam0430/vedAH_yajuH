<li>Prajāpati created the (Soma-)sacrifice. He took it and performed it. When he had performed it, he felt like one emptied out. He saw this sacrificial performance, the Sautrāmaṇī, and performed it, and then he was again replenished; and, indeed, he who performs the Soma-sacrifice is, as it were, emptied out, for his wealth, his prosperity is, as it were, taken from him.</li>

<li>Having performed a Soma-sacrifice one ought to perform the Sautrāmaṇī: as a cow that has been milked would replenish again, even so, indeed, does he replenish himself,&ndash;he replenishes himself by offspring and cattle; and, verily, he who, knowing this, performs the Sautrāmaṇī, or he who (even) knows this, establishes himself in this world, and wins the heavenly world.</li>

<p>242:3 The &lsquo;praisha&rsquo; are the directions by which the Maitrāvaruṇa calls on the Hotr̥ to recite the offering-formulas (cf. part ii, p. 183, note 2). For the fore-offerings of the three victims, these directions are given, Vāj. S. XXI, 29-40. They all commence with &lsquo;Hotā  yakshat&rsquo; (may the Hotr̥ worship!), and end with &lsquo;payaḥ somaḥ parisrutā ghr̥taṁ madhu vyantv ājyasya hotar yaja&rsquo; (milk, Soma, with parisrut-liquor, ghee, honey,&ndash;may they partake of the butter, Hotr̥ worship!).&#160;<a href="#fnref:10" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>243:1 ? Literally, &lsquo;by (way of) milk&rsquo;&ndash;or, perhaps, &lsquo;by the admixture of milk&ndash;Soma is (here, as it were) produced.&rsquo;&#160;<a href="#fnref:11" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:12">
<p>243:2 In all the directions referred to, the three deities are named.&#160;<a href="#fnref:12" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:13">
<p>243:3 The two Aśvins are the physicians of the gods. Cf. IV, 1, 5, 8 seqq.; XII, 7, 2, 3.&#160;<a href="#fnref:13" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:14">
<p>244:1 This refers to the puronuvākyās and yājyās of the oblations of omentum (vapā) of the three victims. For these formulas the three verses, Vāj. S. XX, 67-69, are used in such a way that verse 1 forms the anuvākyā, and verse 2 the yājyā, of the Aśvins’ oblation; verse 2 the anuvākyā, and verse 3 the yājyā, of Sarasvatī&rsquo;s oblation; and verse 3 the anuvākyā, and verse 1 the yājyā, of Indra&rsquo;s oblation. In each of the three verses all the three deities are mentioned.&ndash;In exactly the same way the three verses, XX, 70-72, are used as the anuvākyās and yājyās of the three paśupuroḍāśas; and 73-75 as those of the chief oblations (havis) of meat-portions.&#160;<a href="#fnref:14" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:15">
<p>244:2 The Āprīs (propitiatory verses, cf. part ii, p. 185) are the offering-formulas (yājyā) of the eleven (or twelve) fore-offerings (prayāja) of the animal sacrifice. Those used on the present occasion are the twelve verses given, Vāj. S. XX, 55-66; there being on this occasion (in the second and third places) fore-offerings both to Tanūnapāt and Narāśaṁsa. In each of these verses, again, all three deities are referred to.&#160;<a href="#fnref:15" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:16">
<p>244:3 I do not exactly know what formulas are thereby referred to.  It can hardly be the praishas of the anuyājas (Vāj. S. XXI, 48-58), as these are not in the jagatī, but in the (ārshī) trishṭubh metre; though certainly each of them contains the names of the three deities.&#160;<a href="#fnref:16" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:17">
<p>245:1 Viz. the Adhvaryu, and his two assistants, the Pratiprasthātr̥ and Agnīdh. Cf. XII, 8, 1, 3 seqq.&#160;<a href="#fnref:17" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:18">
<p>246:1 Viz. inasmuch as three priests partake of each of the first two cups of milk, and of the first two cups of Surd-liquor, and each priest drinks twice.&#160;<a href="#fnref:18" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:19">
<p>248:1 See p. 244, note , where it is shown that each of the three verses serves successively as puronuvākyā and as yājyā.&#160;<a href="#fnref:19" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
