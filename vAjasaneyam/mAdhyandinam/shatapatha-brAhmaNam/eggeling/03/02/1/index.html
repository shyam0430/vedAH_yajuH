<li>South of the Āhavanīya he spreads two black antelope skins on the ground, with the neck parts towards the east: thereon he consecrates him. If there are two (skins), they are an image of these two worlds (heaven and earth), and thus he consecrates him on these two worlds.</li>

Those which are of a brownish yellow colour <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, are an image of the atmosphere.

<p>where the white and black (hair) join, he mutters (Vāj. S.

<li>And when he says, &lsquo;I touch you,&rsquo; he means to say, &lsquo;I enter into you.&rsquo; &lsquo;Do ye guard me up to the goal of this sacrifice!&rsquo; whereby he says, &lsquo;Do ye protect me until the completion of this sacrifice!&rsquo;</li>

<li>He then kneels down with his right knee (on the skin), with the text, &lsquo;Thou art a refuge: afford me refuge!&rsquo; for the skin (carma) of the black deer it is indeed among men, but among the gods it is a refuge (śarma): therefore he says, &lsquo;Thou art a refuge: afford me refuge.&rsquo; &lsquo;Homage be to thee: injure me not!&rsquo; Now he who raises himself upon the sacrifice <sup id="fnref1:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> doubtless raises himself to one that is his better; for the black deer skin is a (means of) sacrifice.

</ol>
<h2 id="09">09</h2>
<ol start="9">
<li>He must indeed sit down first on the hind part (of the skin). Were he, on the other hand, to sit down at once in the middle (of the skin), and were</li>
</ol>
<p>any one there to curse him, saying, &lsquo;He shall either become demented or fall down headlong!&rsquo; then that would indeed come to pass. Let him therefore first sit down on the hind part (of the skin).</p>
<h2 id="10">10</h2>
<ol start="10">
<li>He then girds himself with the zone. For once upon a time when the Aṅgiras were consecrated, they were seized with weakness, for they had prepared no other food but fast-milk. They then perceived this (source of) strength (viz. the zone), and this (source of) strength they put in (or round) the middle of their body as a (means of attaining) completion: and thereby they attained completion. And so does he now put that (source of) strength in the middle of his body and thereby attain completion.</li>

<li>It is made of hemp. Hempen it is in order to be soft. Now when Prajāpati, having become an embryo, sprung forth from that sacrifice, that which was nearest to him, the amnion, became hempen threads: hence they smell putrid. And that which was the outer membrane (and placenta) became the garment of the consecrated. Now the amnion lies under the outer membrane, and hence that (zone) is worn under the garment. And in like manner as Prajāpati, having become an embryo, sprung forth from that sacrifice, so does he become an embryo and spring forth from that sacrifice.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="12">12</h2>
<ol start="12">
<li>It (the cord) is a triple one, because food is threefold, food being cattle. (Moreover) the father and mother (are two), and that which is born is a third: hence it is a triple (cord).</li>

<ol start="13">
<li>It is intertwined with a shoot of reed (muñja) grass, for the sake of chasing away the evil spirits, the reed being a thunderbolt. It is plaited after</li>

For were it to be twisted <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> sunwise (from left to right) as any other cords, it would be human; and were it twisted contrary to the course of the sun, it would be sacred to the Fathers: hence it is plaited after the manner of a braid of hair.</p>
<h2 id="14">14</h2>
<ol start="14">
<li>He girds himself with it, with the text (Vāj. S. IV, 10), &lsquo;Thou art the strength of the Aṅgiras,&rsquo;&ndash;for the Aṅgiras perceived this (source of) strength; &lsquo;soft as wool, bestow thou strength on me!&rsquo; there is nothing obscure in this.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="15">15</h2>
<ol start="15">
<li>He then tucks up the end of his (nether) garment, with the text, &lsquo;Thou art Soma&rsquo;s tuck.&rsquo; For heretofore it was the tuck of him, the unconsecrated; but now that he is consecrated, it is that of Soma <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>: therefore he says, &lsquo;Thou art Soma&rsquo;s tuck.&rsquo;</li>

<ol start="16">
<li>He then wraps up (his head) <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>. For he who is consecrated becomes an embryo; and embryos are enveloped both by the amnion and the outer membrane: therefore he covers (his head).</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="17">17</h2>
<ol start="17">
<li>He covers himself, with the text, &lsquo;Thou art Vishṇu&rsquo;s refuge, the refuge of the sacrificer.&rsquo; He who is consecrated indeed becomes both Vishṇu and a sacrificer; for when he is consecrated, he is Vishṇu; and when he sacrifices, he is the sacrificer: therefore he says, &lsquo;Thou art Vishṇu&rsquo;s refuge, the refuge of the sacrificer.&rsquo;</li>

<li>Thereupon he ties a black deer&rsquo;s horn to the</li>
</ol>
<p>end (of his garment <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>). Now the gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Prajāpati, entered upon their father Prajāpati&rsquo;s inheritance: the gods came in for the Mind and the Asuras for Speech. Thereby the gods came in for the sacrifice and Asuras for speech; the gods for yonder (heaven) and the Asuras for this (earth).</p>
<h2 id="19">19</h2>
<ol start="19">
<li>The gods said to Yajña (m., the sacrifice), &lsquo;That Vāc (f., speech) is a woman: beckon her, and she will certainly call thee to her.&rsquo; Or it may be, he himself thought, &lsquo;That Vāc is a woman: I will beckon her and she will certainly call me to her.&rsquo; He accordingly beckoned her. She, however, at first disdained him from the distance: and hence a woman, when beckoned by a man, at first disdains him from the distance. He said, &lsquo;She has disdained me from the distance.&rsquo;</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="20">20</h2>
<ol start="20">
<li>They said, &lsquo;Do but beckon her, reverend sir, and she will certainly call thee to her.&rsquo; He beckoned her; but she only replied to him, as it were, by shaking her head: and hence a woman, when beckoned by a man, only replies to him, as it were, by shaking her head. He said, &lsquo;She has only replied to me by shaking her head.&rsquo;</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="21">21</h2>
<ol start="21">
<li>They said, &lsquo;Do but beckon her, reverend sir, and she will certainly call thee to her.&rsquo; He beckoned her, and she called him to her; and hence a woman at last calls the man to her. He said, &lsquo;She has indeed called me.&rsquo;</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="22">22</h2>
<ol start="22">
<li>The gods reflected, &lsquo;That Vāc being a woman, we must take care lest she should allure him <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>.&ndash;Say to her, &ldquo;Come hither to me where I stand!&rdquo; and report to us her having come.&rsquo; She then went up to where he was standing. Hence a woman goes to a man who stays in a well-trimmed (house). He reported to them her having come, saying, &lsquo;She has indeed come.&rsquo;</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="23">23</h2>
<ol start="23">
<li>The gods then cut her off from the Asuras; and having gained possession of her and enveloped her completely in fire, they offered her up as a holocaust, it being an offering of the gods <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>. And in that they offered her with an anushṭubh verse, thereby they made her their own; and the Asuras, being deprived of speech, were undone, crying, &lsquo;He ’lavaḥ! he ’lavaḥ <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>!</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="24">24</h2>
<ol start="24">
<li>Such was the unintelligible speech which they then uttered,&ndash;and he (who speaks thus) is a Mleccḥa (barbarian). Hence let no Brahman speak barbarous language, since such is the speech of the Asuras. Thus alone he deprives his spiteful enemies of speech; and whosoever knows this, his enemies, being deprived of speech, are undone.</li>

<li>That Yajña (sacrifice) lusted after Vāc (speech <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>), thinking, &lsquo;May I pair with her!&rsquo; He united with her.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="26">26</h2>
<ol start="26">
<li>Indra then thought within himself, &lsquo;Surely a great monster will spring from this union of Yajña and Vāc: [I must take care] lest it should get the better of me.&rsquo; Indra himself then became an embryo and entered into that union.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="27">27</h2>
<ol start="27">
<li>Now when he was born after a year&rsquo;s time, he thought within himself, &lsquo;Verily of great vigour is this womb which has contained me: [I must take care] that no great monster shall be born from it after me, lest it should get the better of me!&rsquo;</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="28">28</h2>
<ol start="28">
<li>Having seized and pressed it tightly, he tore it off and put it on the head of Yajña (sacrifice <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>);for the black (antelope) is the sacrifice: the black deer skin is the same as that sacrifice, and the black deer&rsquo;s horn is the same as that womb. And because it was by pressing it tightly together that Indra tore out (the womb), therefore it (the horn) is bound tightly (to the end of the garment); and as Indra,</li>
</ol>
<p>having become an embryo, sprang from that union, so is he (the sacrificer), after becoming an embryo, born from that union (of the skin and the horn).</p>
<h2 id="29">29</h2>
<ol start="29">
<li>He ties it (to the end of the garment) with the open part upwards, for it is in this way that the womb bears the embryo. He then touches with it his forehead close over the right eyebrow, with the text, &lsquo;Thou art Indra&rsquo;s womb,&rsquo;&ndash;for it is indeed Indra&rsquo;s womb, since in entering it he enters thereby <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>, and in being born he is born therefrom: therefore he says, &lsquo;Thou art Indra&rsquo;s womb.&rsquo;</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="30">30</h2>
<ol start="30">
<li>Thereupon he draws (with the horn) the (&rsquo;easterly&rsquo;) line, with the text, &lsquo;Make the crops full-eared!&rsquo; Thereby he produces the sacrifice; for when there is a good year, then there is abundant (material) for sacrifice; but when there is a bad year, then there is not even enough for himself: hence he thereby produces the sacrifice.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="31">31</h2>
<ol start="31">
<li>And let not the consecrated henceforth scratch himself either with a chip of wood or with his nail. For he who is consecrated becomes an embryo; and were any one to scratch an embryo either with a chip of wood or his nail, thereby expelling it, it would die <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>.

<p>own womb <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup> does not injure its offspring, and that black deer&rsquo;s horn being indeed his own womb, that (horn) does not injure him; and therefore the consecrated should scratch himself with the black deer&rsquo;s horn and with nothing but the black deer&rsquo;s horn.</p>

<p>31:1 Yoshā vā iyaṁ vāg yad enaṁ na yuvitā. The St. Petersburg Dict. (s. v. yu) takes it differently, &lsquo;That Vāc is indeed a woman, since she does not wish to draw him towards herself (i.e. since she does not want him to come near her).&rsquo; Sāyaṇa, on the other hand, explains it elliptically, &lsquo;Since she has not joined him (no confidence can be placed in her).&rsquo; The Kāṇva text reads: Ta u ha devā bibhayāṁ cakrur yoshā vā iyam iti yad vā enam na yuvīteti. Perhaps in our passage also we should read &lsquo;yuvīta&rsquo; (as proposed by Delbrück, Syntact. Forschungen III, p. 79), and translate, &lsquo;Verily that Vāc is a woman: (it is to be feared) that she will [or, it is to be hoped that she will not] allure him [viz. so. that Yajña also would fall to the share of the Asuras];&rsquo; &lsquo;Dass sie ihn nur nicht an sich fesselt!&rsquo; For similar elliptic constructions with yad and the optative, see paragraphs 26 and 27; and II, 2, 4, 3 [&lsquo;Dass er mich nur nicht auffrisst!&rsquo;]; IV, 3, 5, 3 (&lsquo;Dass uns nur die Rakshas nichts zu Leide thun!&rsquo;); IV, 6, 9, 1.
