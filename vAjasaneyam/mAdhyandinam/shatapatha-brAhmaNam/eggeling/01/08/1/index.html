<h2 id="05">05</h2>
<ol start="5">
<li>After he had reared it in this way, he took it down to the sea. And in the same year which the fish had indicated to him, he attended to (the advice of the fish) by preparing a ship; and when the flood had risen, he entered into the ship. The fish then swam up to him, and to its horn he tied the rope of the ship, and by that means he <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> passed swiftly up to yonder northern mountain.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="06">06</h2>

<li>Being desirous of offspring, he engaged in worshipping and austerities. During this time he also performed a pāka-sacrifice: he offered up in the waters clarified butter, sour milk, whey, and curds. Thence a woman was produced in a year: becoming quite solid <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> she rose; clarified butter gathered in her footprint.

She either agreed or did not agree <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>, but passed by them. She came to Manu.</li>

<li>Manu said to her, &lsquo;Who art thou?&rsquo; &lsquo;Thy daughter,&rsquo; she replied. &lsquo;How, illustrious one, (art thou) my daughter?&rsquo; he asked. She replied,</li>

<p>&lsquo;Those offerings (of) clarified butter, sour milk, whey, and curds, which thou madest in the waters, with them thou hast begotten me. I am the blessing (benediction): make use of me at the sacrifice! If thou wilt make use of me at the sacrifice, thou wilt become rich in offspring and cattle. Whatever blessing thou shalt invoke through me, all that shall be granted to thee!&rsquo; He accordingly made use of her (as the benediction) in the middle of the sacrifice; for what is intermediate between the fore-offerings and the after-offerings, is the middle of the sacrifice.</p>
<h2 id="10">10</h2>

<li>With her he went on worshipping and performing austerities, wishing for offspring. Through her he generated this race, which is this race of Manu; and whatever blessing he invoked through her, all that was granted to him.</li>

<li>It (the iḍā) consists of a fivefold cutting; for the iḍā, doubtless, means cattle, and cattle consist of five parts <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>: for this reason it (the iḍā) consists of a fivefold cutting.</li>

Having then handed over the former (the iḍā) to the Hotr̥ <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>, he passes by him towards the south.</p>

He said to Manu, &ldquo;When I am full-grown, in the same year the flood will come,&rdquo;&rsquo; Max Müller. &lsquo;Straightway he became a large fish; for he waxes to the utmost,&rsquo; Muir. Perhaps jḥasha is here intended for the name of some fabulous horned fish (cf. śr̥ṅgi, śr̥ṅgī). In the Black Yajur-veda (Taitt. S. I, 7, 1; II, 6, 7) the  iḍā is represented as a cow, produced by Mitra and Varuṇa (see below, par. 24). Perhaps it was this version and the symbolical representation of the iḍā as meaning cattle, which suggested the notion of a horned fish, in adapting an older legend.&#160;<a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>217:1 I adopt here, though not without hesitation, the interpretation proposed in the St. Petersb. Dict. (s.v. upa-ās), which the separation of mām from the verb favours. Professor Max Müller translates: &lsquo;Build a ship then, and worship me.&rsquo; Dr. Muir: &lsquo;Thou shalt, therefore, construct a ship, and resort to me.&rsquo; The Mahābhārata has: &lsquo;When standing on the ship, thou shalt look out for me: I shall be recognisable (by my being) furnished with a horn,&rsquo; which, after all, may furnish the correct explanation of our passage.&#160;<a href="#fnref:4" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

Professor Weber&rsquo;s edition has ati-dudrāva, as read by his best MS., &lsquo;it (or he) sailed across the mountain.&rsquo; The reading of the other MSS. adhi-dudrāva must be a clerical error, most likely for abhi-dudrāva. Professor Müller translates: &lsquo;The fish carried him by it over the northern mountain.&rsquo; Dr. Muir: &lsquo;By this means he passed over (or, he hastened to) this northern mountain.&rsquo;&#160;<a href="#fnref:5" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

III, 4, 6, and note on I, 7, 3, 20). According to some authorities, the iḍā consists of four cuttings only (cf.

Āśv. Ś. I, 7, 1; Kāty. III, 4, 9; Hillebrandt, op. cit., p. 124. In Śat. Br. XII, 2, 4, 5 the fore-finger is called annāditamā, or the finger &lsquo;which eats most food;&rsquo; cf.
