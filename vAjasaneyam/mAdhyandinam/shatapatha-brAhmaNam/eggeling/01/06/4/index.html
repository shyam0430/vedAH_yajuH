<li>The full-moon oblation, assuredly, belongs to the Vr̥tra-slayer, for by means of it Indra slew Vr̥tra; and this new-moon oblation also represents the slaying of Vr̥tra, since they prepared that invigorating draught for him who had slain Vr̥tra.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="13">13</h2>
<ol start="13">
<li>An offering in honour of the Vr̥tra-slayer, then, is the full-moon sacrifice.

And, verily, he who knows this, overcomes all evil and leaves nothing remaining of evil.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="14">14</h2>
<ol start="14">
<li>Here now some people enter upon the fast when they (still) see (the moon, on the fourteenth day of the half-month), thinking, &lsquo;To-morrow he will not rise: already, then, there is unfailing food for the gods in yonder heaven <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>, and to this we will offer them more from hence (to-morrow)!&rsquo;&ndash;He, indeed, is in a prosperous state with whom, while the old food is still unfailing, fresh food is accruing; for such a one has indeed abundant food. However, he is not now offering Soma, but he is offering milk (i.e. the Sānnāyya), and that (milk) becomes king Soma <sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup> (in yonder world):</li>

<h2 id="15">15</h2>

<li>But as they (the cows), previously (to the new moon), eat mere plants (not imbued with the moon or Soma), and drink mere water, and yield mere milk,&ndash;so that (milk which they offer on the day before new moon, is not imbued with Soma, is ordinary milk). For king Soma, the food of the gods, indeed, is no other than the moon. When he is not seen that night either in the east or in the west, then he visits this world, and here enters into the waters and plants. Having then collected him from the water and plants, he (the performer of the Sānnāyya) causes him to be reproduced from out of the libations; and he (Soma, the moon), being reproduced from the libations, becomes visible in the western sky.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="16">16</h2>
<ol start="16">
<li>Now it is only when that food of the gods is unfailing that it comes back (to men): for him, therefore, who knows this, there is unfailing food in this, and imperishable righteousness in yonder, world.</li>

<h2 id="17">17</h2>
<ol start="17">
<li>Thus during that night (of new moon) food moves away from the gods and comes to this world. Now the gods were desirous as to how that (food) might (be made to) come back to them; how it might not perish away from them. For this they put their trust in those who prepare the libation of sweet and sour milk (sānnāyya), thinking, &lsquo;when they have prepared it, they will offer it to us.&rsquo; And, verily, in him, who knows this, both his own kin and strangers put their trust; for in him, who attains to the highest rank, people indeed put their trust.</li>

<ol start="18">
<li>Now the one that burns there (viz. the sun)</li>
</ol>
<p>is, assuredly, no other than Indra, and that moon is no other than Vr̥tra. But the former is of a nature hostile to the latter, and for this reason, though this one (the moon, Vr̥tra) had previously (to the night of new moon) risen at a great distance from him (the sun, Indra), he now swims towards him and enters into his open mouth.</p>
<h2 id="19">19</h2>
<ol start="19">
<li>Having swallowed him, he (the sun) rises; and that (other) one is not seen either in the east or in the west.

<li>Having sucked him empty, he throws him out; and the latter, thus sucked out, is seen in the western sky, and again increases; he again increases to serve that (sun) as food: and verily if the spiteful enemy of one who knows this, thrives either by trade or in any other way, he thrives again and again in order to serve him as food.</li>

<p>175:2 Hiraṇyastūpa, of the family of the Aṅgiras, is the reputed author (or seer) of the hymns Rig-veda I, 31-35; IX, 4; 69.

<p>176:1 That is, as would seem, the benefactor, or the treasure (dhanarūpa, Sāyaṇa) of the gods. Indra is the chief of the Vasus. Indra being so beneficent and important a personage, it was, according to Sāyaṇa, worth Agni&rsquo;s while to stay with him. Possibly also a play on the word Vasu, and vas, &rsquo;to dwell,&rsquo; is intended here.&#160;<a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<li id="fn:5">
<p>176:3 The identification of the Soma (plant and juice) with the moon already occurs in some of the hymns of the Rig-veda, all of which, however, probably belong to the later ones. According to the St. Petersburg Dictionary, the identification was probably suggested by the circumstance that indu, &lsquo;drop, spark,&rsquo; applies both to the Soma and the moon. Rig-veda X, 85, 3 says that of that Soma which the priests know, no one ever eats.&rsquo;&#160;<a href="#fnref:5" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<li id="fn:8">
<p>177:3 In Taitt. S. II, 5, 3, 2 seq. the corresponding story is applied directly to the Sānnāyya. In consequence of the struggle with Vr̥tra., Indra lost his energy, which fell to the earth and produced plants and shrubs. He thereupon complained to Prajāpati, who bade the cattle collect (sam-nī) it again by browsing the plants and shrubs. It was then milked out from them, and as the milk did not agree with Indra, it was boiled, and as it still did not satisfy Indra, it was mixed with sour milk.&#160;<a href="#fnref:8" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:9">
<p>177:4 Na mayi śrayate, &rsquo;literally it does not stay in me&rsquo; = na tishṭḥati, na sātmyam bhajate, Sāyaṇa. The author here (as in I, 8, I, 17) connects, or confounds, the verb śri with śrā, &rsquo;to cook, make done,&rsquo;&ndash;hence, &lsquo;it does not boil in me;&rsquo; the milk being warm, or, as it were, boiled, when it comes from the cow, see II, 2, 4, 15. Hence also boiled milk is mixed with the Soma.&#160;<a href="#fnref:9" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:10">
<p>178:1 The author here endeavours to establish some connection between the Sānnāyya (or offering of sweet and sour milk to Indra, which may take the place of the second sacrificial cake offered, at the new-moon sacrifice, to Indra and Agni) and the Soma libations. Sāyaṇa refers to the passage Taitt. Br. I, 4, 7, 6-7, where it is stated that for the morning libation the Soma is to be mixed with boiled milk, for the mid-day libation with sour milk, and for the third (or evening) libation with sour milk that is partly changed into butter (nītamiśra).&#160;<a href="#fnref:10" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>178:2 Āpyāyeta. On the strengthening or increasing (āpyāyanam) of the Soma-plant by sprinkling it with water before the juice is extracted, see III, 4, 3, 12 seq. Sāyaṇa seems to take the passage thus: &lsquo;In the same way as the Soma would make strong (? or become strong), so also the sānnāyyam destroys that evil, the jaundice, in those who drink it.&rsquo;&#160;<a href="#fnref:11" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<li id="fn:12">
<p>178:3 By the admixture of milk the Soma-juice loses its brownish colour, and is therefore apparently considered to produce the same effect in those who drink the mixture.&#160;<a href="#fnref:12" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<li id="fn:13">
<p>178:4 The preparation of the sānnāyya, as it is now practised by priests in Western India, is thus described by Haug (Ait. Br. II, p. 443):  &lsquo;The Adhvaryu takes the milk from three cows called Gaṅgā, Yamuna, and Sarasvatī, on the morning and evening, and gives it to the Āgnīdhra. Half the milk is first drawn from the udder of each of the three cows under the recital of mantras; then the same is done silently. The milk is taken from these cows on the evening of the new-moon day, and on the morning of the following day, the so-called Pratipad (the first day of the month). The milk drawn on the evening is made hot, and lime-juice poured over it to make it sour; whereupon it is hung up. The fresh milk of the following morning is then mixed with it, and both are sacrificed along with the Puroḍāśa. Only he who has already performed the Agnishṭoma is allowed to sacrifice the Sānnāyya at the Darśapūrṇima ishṭi. (Oral information.)&rsquo; In Vāj. S. I, 4 (Śat. Br. I, 7, 1, 17; Katy. IV, 2, 25, 26) the names of the three cows are given as Viśvāyu, Viśvakarman, and Viśvadhāyus, unless these are intended merely for epithets or mystic names. Cf. p. 188 note; Weber, Ind. Stud. IX, 232. Instead of the lime-juice, mentioned by Haug as used for rennet, Katy. IV, 2, 33 prescribes that the milk remaining from the Agnihotra of the preceding evening, and since become sour, should be used.&#160;<a href="#fnref:13" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>182:1 With this explanation of the disappearance of the moon may be compared the later notion of the sun and moon being swallowed by the demon Rāhu, at the time of the eclipses.&#160;<a href="#fnref:19" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>182:2 Kāty. IV, 2, 10 leaves it optional whether the libation of mixed  sweet and sour milk is to be offered to Indra or to Mahendra. According to IV, 5, 25, however, such option seems to be permitted only so far as the first performance is concerned, after which one is apparently bound to go on offering during the rest of one&rsquo;s life to whichever deity one has chosen at the beginning. Taitt. S. II, 5, 4, 4, lays it down as the rule that only a gataśrī (one who has reached the highest grade of prosperity), viz. a brāhmaṇa versed in the three Vedas (śuśruvān = vedatrayābhijña, Sāyaṇa, the head of a village (grāmaṇī), and a rājanya, can make offering to Mahendra, since he is their special deity. Others, however, may do the same, after offering the sānnāyyam to Indra for a whole year, and on the expiration of it a rice-cake on eight potsherds to Agni, as the Keeper of Vows.&#160;<a href="#fnref:20" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
