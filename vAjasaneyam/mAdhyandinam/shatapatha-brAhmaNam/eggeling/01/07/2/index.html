<ol start="4">
<li>And further, inasmuch as he is bound to wish for offspring, for that reason he is born as (owing) a debt to the fathers: hence when there is (provided by him) a continued, uninterrupted lineage, it is for them that he does this.</li>

<h2 id="05">05</h2>
<ol start="5">
<li>And further, inasmuch as he is bound to practise hospitality, for that reason he is born as (owing) a debt to men: hence when he harbours them, when he offers food to them, it is (in discharge of his debt) to them that he does so.

</ol>
<h2 id="06">06</h2>
<ol start="6">
<li>And, accordingly, in that he is born as (owing) a debt to the gods, in regard to that he satisfies (ava-day) them by sacrificing; and when he makes offerings in the fire, he thereby satisfies them in regard to that (debt): hence whatever they offer up in the fire, is called avadānam (sacrificial portion) <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</li>

<h2 id="07">07</h2>

<li>Now this (oblation) consists of four cuttings; (the reason for this is, that) there is here first, the invitatory prayer (anuvākyā), then the offering-prayer (yājyā), then the vashaṭ-call, and as the fourth, the deity for which the sacrificial food is</li>
</ol>
<p>(destined): for in this way the deities are dependent on the sacrificial portions, or the portions are dependent on the deities: hence what fifth cutting there is (made by some), that is redundant, for&ndash;for whom is he to cut it? For this reason it consists of four cuttings.</p>
<h2 id="08">08</h2>
<ol start="8">
<li>But a fivefold cutting also takes place (with some people): fivefold is the sacrifice, fivefold the animal victim, and five seasons there are in the year,&ndash;such is the perfection of the fivefold cutting; and he, assuredly, will have abundant offspring and cattle for whom, knowing this, the fivefold cutting is made. The fourfold cutting, however, is the approved (practice) among the Kuru-Pañcālas, and for this reason a fourfold cutting takes place (with us <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>).</li>

<li>Let him cut off only a moderate quantity; for were he to cut off a large quantity, he would make it human; and what is human is inauspicious at the sacrifice. Let him therefore cut off only a moderate quantity, lest he should do what is inauspicious at the sacrifice.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="10">10</h2>
<ol start="10">
<li>Having made an under-layer of butter (in the juhū-spoon) and cut off twice from the havis, he then pours over it some butter. There are, indeed, two (kinds of) oblations; the oblation of Soma being one, and the oblation of (or rather, with) butter being the other. Now the one, viz. the Soma-oblation, is (an oblation) by itself; and the other, viz. the butter-oblation, is the same as the offering of havis (rice, milk, &amp;c.) and the animal offering <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>; hence he thereby makes it (the cake) butter, and therefore butter is on both sides of it. Butter, doubtless, is palatable to the gods; hence he thereby renders it palatable to the gods: for this reason butter is on both sides of it.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="11">11</h2>
<ol start="11">
<li>The invitatory prayer (anuvākyā, f.), doubtless, is yonder (sky), and the offering-prayer (yājyā, f.) is this (earth)&ndash;these two are females. With each of these two the vashaṭ-call (vashaṭkāra, m.) makes up a pair <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. Now the vashaṭ, indeed,</li>
</ol>
<p>is no other than that scorching one (the sun). When he rises he approaches yonder (sky); and when he sets he approaches this (earth): hence whatever is brought forth here by these two, that they bring forth through that male.</p>
<h2 id="12">12</h2>
<ol start="12">
<li>Having recited the invitatory prayer and pronounced the offering-prayer <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>, he afterwards (paścāt) utters the vashaṭ formula; for from behind (paścāt) the male approaches the female: hence, after placing those two in front, he causes them to be approached by that male, the vashaṭ. For the same reason let him make the offering either simultaneously with the vashaṭ or (immediately) after the vashaṭ has been pronounced.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="13">13</h2>
<ol start="13">
<li>A vessel of the gods, doubtless, is that vashaṭ. Even as, after ladling, one would mete out (food) into a vessel, so here.

<p>190:1 The wording of this passage is very ambiguous; so much so indeed, that it could also be taken in the sense that &lsquo;whoever exists, is born as (one to whom) a debt (is owed) from the gods,&rsquo; &amp;c.; cf. I, 1, 2, 19: &lsquo;Whichever deities are chosen (for the oblations), they consider it as a debt (clue from them), that they are bound to fulfil whatever wish he entertains while taking the oblation.&rsquo; But see Taitt. Br. VI, 3, 10, 5: &lsquo;Verily, a Brāhmaṇa who is born, is born as owing a debt in respect to three things: in the shape of sacred study (brahmacarya) to the R̥shis, in the shape of sacrifice to the gods, and in the shape of offspring to the fathers. Free from debt, verily, is he who has a son, who is a sacrificer, who lives (for a time with a guru) as a religious student.&rsquo; Ath.-veda VI, 117, 3 (Taitt. Br. III, 7, 9, 8): &lsquo;May we be debtless in this, debtless in the other, debtless in the third, world! What worlds (paths, Taitt. Br.) there are trodden by the gods and trodden by the fathers,&ndash;may we abide debtless on all (those) paths!&rsquo;&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>191:1 The word is really derived from ava-dā (do), &rsquo;to cut off.&rsquo; The Taitt. Br. gives the same fanciful etymological explanation of the term as here.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<li id="fn:3">
<p>192:1 The four &lsquo;cuttings&rsquo; of which each oblation of rice-cake consists are made in the following way: first, some clarified butter, &lsquo;cut out&rsquo; or drawn from the butter in the dhruvā-spoon by means of the sruva (dipping-spoon) and poured into the juhū (this is called the upastaraṇa or under-layer of butter); second and third, two pieces of the size of a thumb&rsquo;s joint, cut out from the centre and the fore-part of the rice-cake and laid on that butter; and fourth, some clarified butter poured on these pieces of cake (the technical name of this basting of butter being abhighāraṇa). The family of the Jamadagnis, which is mentioned as always making five cuttings (Kāty. I, 9, 3-4), take three pieces of cake instead of two, viz. an additional one from the back (or west) part of the cake. Yājñika Deva on Kāty. quotes a couplet from some Smr̥ti, in which the Vatsas, the Vidas, and the Ārshṭisheṇas are mentioned beside the Jamadagnis, as pañcāvattinaḥ or making five cuttings. At the Upāṁśuyāja (low-voiced offering),&ndash;which is performed between the cake-oblation to Agni and that to Agni-Soma at the full moon, and between the cake-oblation to Agni and that to Indra-Agni (or the sānnāyya, or oblation of sweet and sour milk, to Indra) at the new moon, and which consists entirely of butter,&ndash;the four cuttings are effected in the same way as described  page 174 note. At the sānnāyya, two (or three) sruva-fuls of both the sweet and the sour milk take the place of the two (or three) pieces of cake.&#160;<a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>195:1 In this passage the invitatory formula (anuvākyā or puro&rsquo;nuvākyā), which is in the gāyatrī metre, is identified with the sky, and the offering-formula (yājyā), which is in the trishṭubh metre, with the earth. On the other hand, the gāyatrī also is the earth (cf. I, 4, I, 34), and the trishṭubh the sky; so that, according to this mode of reasoning, there is not only an intimate connection between the two metres, but actual identity. The gāyatrī verse, used as invitatory formula, on the occasion of the rice-cake offering to Agni, is Rig-veda VIII, 4.4, 16 [agnir mūrdhā divaḥ kakut, &lsquo;Agni, the head and summit of the sky,&rsquo; &amp;c.]; with that to Agni and Soma, at the full-moon sacrifice, Rig-veda I, 93, 3 [agnīshomau savedasau, sahūtī vanatam giraḥ, &lsquo;O Agni and Soma, of self-same wealth and invocation, accept this song!&rsquo; &amp;c.]; and to Indra and Agni, at the new moon, Rig-veda VII, 94, 7 [indrāgnī avasā gatam, &lsquo;O Indra and Agni, come to us with favour I&rsquo; &amp;c.] or with the (optional) milk-offering (sānnāyyam), at the new moon, Rig-veda I, 8, 1 [endra sānasiṁ rayim, hither, O Indra, bring abundant treasure!!&rsquo; &amp;c.], if to Indra; or Rig-veda VIII, 6, 1 [mahāṅ indro ya ojasā parjanyo vr̥shṭimāṅ iva, &rsquo;the Great Indra, who in might is equal to the rainy thunder-cloud,&rsquo; &amp;c.], if to Mahendra.&#160;<a href="#fnref:7" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>196:1 For the notion that there is rain (and consequently food) when heaven and earth are on friendly terms with each other, see I, 8, 3, 12. The rain is the food of the earth; and the food, produced thereby, in its turn furnishes food for the sky (or the gods) in the form of oblations.&#160;<a href="#fnref:9" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>196:2 The br̥hat-sāman (tvam id dhi havāmahe, &lsquo;on thee, indeed, we call,&rsquo; &amp;c., Sāma-veda II, 159-160 = Rig-veda VI, 46, 1-2) and the rathantara-sāman (abhi tvā śūra nonumaḥ, &rsquo;to thee, O Hero, we call,&rsquo; &amp;c., Sāma-veda II, 30-31 = Rig-veda VII, 32, 22-23) are two of the most highly prized Sāma-hymns, which are especially used in forming the so-called pr̥shṭḥas, or combinations of two hymns in such a way that one of them (being a mystic representation of the embryo) is enclosed in the other, which is supposed to represent the womb. In these symbolical combinations the br̥hat and rathantara, which must never be used together, are often employed as the enclosing chants, representative of the womb. They are already mentioned in Rig-veda X, 181. See also Śat. Br. IX, 1, 2, 36-37. Taitt. S. VII, 1, I, 4, Prajāpati is said to have first created from his mouth Agni together with the Gāyatrī, the Rathantara-sāman, the Brāhmaṇa, and the goat; and then from his chest and arms Indra, the Trishṭubh, the Br̥hat-sāman, the Rājanya, and the ram.&#160;<a href="#fnref:10" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>199:1 Sumeka is taken by the St. Petersburg Dictionary to mean &lsquo;firmly established;&rsquo; by Grassmann, &lsquo;bountiful,&rsquo; literally &lsquo;well-showering.&rsquo; Our author identifies it with su-eka. The words sabdam (śabdam, Kāṇva rec., ? = the sounding one) and sagarā are obscure; yavya here apparently means, &lsquo;consisting of the yavas or half-months.&rsquo;&#160;<a href="#fnref:18" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>199:2 The term yāvihotram is obscure, and does not seem to occur anywhere else. The Kāṇva MS. reads yāmihotram (? = jāmihotram).
