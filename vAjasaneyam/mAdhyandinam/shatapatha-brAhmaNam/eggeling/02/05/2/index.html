<li>Now it was by means of the Vaiśvadeva that Prajāpati produced living beings. The beings produced by him ate (ghas) Varuṇa&rsquo;s barley corn; for originally the barley belonged to Varuṇa. And from their eating Varuṇa&rsquo;s barley corn the name Varuṇapraghāsāḥ (is derived).</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="02">02</h2>
<ol start="2">
<li>Varuṇa seized them; and on being seized by Varuṇa, they became rent all over <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>; and they lay and sat them down breathing in and breathing out. The out-breathing and in-breathing forsook them not, but all the other deities <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> forsook them; and owing to these two, the creatures did not perish.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="03">03</h2>
<ol start="3">
<li>Prajāpati healed them by means of that oblation: both the creatures that were born and those that were unborn he delivered from Varuṇa&rsquo;s noose; and his creatures were born without disease and blemish.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="04">04</h2>
<ol start="4">
<li>Now when this (sacrificer) performs these offerings in the fourth month (after the Vaiśvadeva), he does so either because thus Varuṇa does not seize his offspring, or because the gods performed (the same offering); and both the children that have been born to him and those that are yet unborn he thereby delivers from Varuṇa&rsquo;s noose, and his children are born without disease and blemish. This is why he performs these offerings in the fourth month.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="05">05</h2>
<ol start="5">
<li>At this (sacrifice) there are two altars and two fires <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. The reason why there are two altars and two</li>
</ol>
<p>fires, is that thereby one frees the creatures from Varuṇa&rsquo;s noose both ways,&ndash;on the one side (he frees) the upright, and on the other those looking to the ground: this is why there are two altars and two fires.</p>
<h2 id="06">06</h2>
<ol start="6">
<li>On the northern (uttara) altar he raises the uttara-vedi (upper or north altar), not on the southern one. Varuṇa, doubtless, is the nobility, and the Maruts are the people: he thus makes the nobility superior (uttara) to the people; and hence people here serve the Kshatriya, placed above them. This is why he raises the uttara-vedi on the northern, not on the southern altar.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="07">07</h2>
<ol start="7">
<li>In the first place there are those five oblations <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. For by means of those five oblations Prajāpati produced the creatures, with them he freed the creatures both ways from Varuṇa&rsquo;s noose,&ndash;on the one side (he freed) the upright, and on the other those that tend to the ground: this is why there are those five oblations.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="08">08</h2>
<ol start="8">
<li>Then follows a cake on twelve potsherds for Indra and Agni. Indra and Agni indeed are the out-breathing and in-breathing: thus this is like</li>
</ol>
<p>doing a good turn to one who has done him a good turn; for it is owing to these two that his creatures <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> did not perish. Hence he now restores his creatures by means of the out-breathing and in-breathing, bestows out-breathing and in-breathing on them: this is why there is a cake on twelve potsherds for Indra and Agni.</p>
<h2 id="09">09</h2>
<ol start="9">
<li>On both (fires) there is an oblation of curds. It is on milk that the creatures subsist and by means of milk that they were preserved: hence it is with that by which they were preserved and whereon they subsist, that he delivers them both ways from Varuṇa&rsquo;s noose,&ndash;on the one side (he delivers) the upright and on the other those looking to the ground. This is why there is an oblation of curds on both (fires).</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="10">10</h2>
<ol start="10">
<li>The northern one is offered to Varuṇa, since it was Varuṇa who seized his (Prajāpati&rsquo;s) creatures: hence he thereby directly delivers them from Varuṇa&rsquo;s noose. The southern one is offered to the Maruts. It is for the sake of diversity that it is offered to the Maruts; for a repetition he would undoubtedly commit, were he to offer both to Varuṇa. Moreover, it was from the south that the Maruts intended to slay his (Prajāpati&rsquo;s) creatures, and with that share he propitiated them: for this reason the southern (oblation of curds) belongs to the Maruts.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="11">11</h2>
<ol start="11">
<li>Upon both (dishes of curds) he scatters karīra-fruits <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>; for with karīra-fruits Prajāpati</li>
</ol>
<p>bestowed happiness (ka) on the creatures, and so does he (the sacrificer) thereby bestow happiness on the creatures.</p>
<h2 id="12">12</h2>
<ol start="12">
<li>Upon both of them he also scatters śamī-leaves; for with śamī-leaves Prajāpati bestowed bliss (śam) on the creatures, and so does he now thereby bestow bliss on the creatures.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="13">13</h2>
<ol start="13">
<li>Then follows a cake on one potsherd for Ka (Prajāpati); for by that cake on one potsherd to Ka Prajāpati indeed bestowed happiness (ka) on the creatures, and so does he (the sacrificer) now bestow happiness on the creatures by that one-cup cake: this is why there is a cake on one potsherd for Ka.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="14">14</h2>
<ol start="14">
<li>And on the first day, after husking and slightly roasting barley on the Dakshiṇāgni, they prepare therewith as many dishes of karambha <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> as there are members of the (sacrificer&rsquo;s) family, exceeded by one.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="15">15</h2>
<ol start="15">
<li>At the same time they also prepare a ram and a ewe; and if he be able to procure wool other than from eḍaka sheep, let him wash it and stick it on both the ram and the ewe; but should he not be able to procure wool other than from eḍaka sheep, tufts of kuśa grass may also be (used).</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="16">16</h2>
<ol start="16">
<li>The reason why there are a ram and a ewe is chat the ram manifestly is Varuṇa&rsquo;s victim, so that he thereby manifestly delivers the creatures from Varuṇa&rsquo;s noose. They are made of barley, because it was when they (the creatures) had eaten barley that Varuṇa seized them. A pair they form, so that he</li>
</ol>
<p>delivers the creatures from Varuṇa&rsquo;s noose through conjugal union.</p>
<h2 id="17">17</h2>
<ol start="17">
<li>The ewe he places on the southern, and the ram on the northern dish of curds; for in this way alone a proper union is effected, since the woman lies on the left (or north) side of the man.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="18">18</h2>
<ol start="18">
<li>The Adhvaryu places all the (other) sacrificial dishes upon the northern altar; and the Pratiprasthātr̥ places on the southern altar that dish of curds (belonging to the Maruts).</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="19">19</h2>
<ol start="19">
<li>Having thus placed the sacrificial dishes, he churns the fire; and having churned it and placed it on (the hearth) <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>, he offers thereon, The Adhvaryu in the first place says (to the Hotr̥) <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>, &lsquo;Recite to the fire that is being kindled!&rsquo; Both (the Adhvaryu and the Pratiprasthātr̥) then put firewood on (the fire) and both reserve one kindling-stick each; and they both pour out the first libation (āghāra). Thereupon the Adhvaryu says, &lsquo;Agnīdh, trim the fire!&rsquo; Although the summons is given, the trimming does not take place (immediately) <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="20">20</h2>
<ol start="20">
<li>Thereupon the Pratiprasthātr̥ returns (to where the sacrificer&rsquo;s wife is seated). When he is about to lead the wife away, he asks her, &lsquo;With</li>
</ol>
<p>whom holdest thou intercourse?&rsquo; Now when a woman who belongs to one (man) carries on intercourse with another, she undoubtedly commits (a sin) against Varuṇa. He therefore thus asks her, lest she should sacrifice with a secret pang in her mind; for when confessed the sin becomes less, since it becomes truth; this is why he thus asks her. And whatever (connection) she confesses <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> not, that indeed will turn out injurious to her relatives.</p>
<h2 id="21">21</h2>
<ol start="21">
<li>He then makes her say the text (III, 44), &lsquo;We invoke the Maruts, the voracious consumers of enemies, delighting in their porridge.&rsquo; This (verse) is (of like import) as the invitatory prayer she therewith invites them to these dishes <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="22">22</h2>
<ol start="22">
<li>Of these (dishes) there is one for each descendant; as many (children) as there are in the (sacrificer&rsquo;s) family, so many (dishes) there are, exceeded by one.

</ol>
<p>noose those children of his that are as yet unborn: this is why there are (the same number of dishes) exceeded by one.</p>
<h2 id="23">23</h2>
<ol start="23">
<li>(In the form of) dishes they are, because it is from dishes that food is eaten; and of barley they are prepared, because it was when they (the creatures) had eaten the barley corn that Varuṇa seized them. From the winnowing basket she offers, because food is prepared by means of the winnowing basket. The wife offers (together with her husband): thus he delivers his offspring from Varuṇa&rsquo;s noose through conjugal union.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="24">24</h2>
<ol start="24">
<li>She offers previously to the sacrifice, previously to the oblations, since the people do not eat offerings, and the Maruts are the people. Now when Prajāpati&rsquo;s creatures, being seized by Varuṇa, became rent all over, and sat and lay them down, breathing in and breathing out, then the Maruts destroyed their sin; and so do the Maruts now destroy the sin of his (the sacrificer&rsquo;s) offspring. This is why she offers previously to the sacrifice, previously to the oblations.</li>

<h2 id="25">25</h2>
<ol start="25">
<li>He <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> offers in the southern fire, with the text (III, 45), &lsquo;Whatever (sin we have committed) in the village and forest,&rsquo;&ndash;for both in the village and in the forest sin is committed;&ndash;&lsquo;whatever in society and in our own self,&rsquo;&ndash;by &lsquo;whatever (we have committed) in society,&rsquo; he means to say &lsquo;against man;&rsquo; and by &lsquo;whatever in our own self&rsquo; (indriya), he means to say &lsquo;against the gods;&rsquo;&ndash;&lsquo;whatever sin</li>
</ol>
<p>we have here committed, that we expiate by offering, Svāhā!&rsquo;&ndash;whereby he says &lsquo;whatsoever sin we have committed, from all that we rid ourselves.&rsquo;</p>
<h2 id="26">26</h2>
<ol start="26">
<li>Thereupon he mutters the (verse) addressed to Indra and referring to the Maruts.&ndash;Now when the Maruts destroyed the sin of Prajāpati&rsquo;s creatures, he thought within himself, &lsquo;I hope they will not destroy my creatures.&rsquo;</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="27">27</h2>
<ol start="27">
<li>He muttered that (verse) addressed to Indra and referring to the Maruts. Indra indeed is the nobility, and the Maruts are the people; and the nobility are the controllers of the people: &lsquo;They shall be controlled,&rsquo; he thought; and therefore (that verse, Vāj. S. III, 46) is addressed to Indra.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="28">28</h2>
<ol start="28">
<li>&lsquo;Let there not, O Indra, be (fight) for us here in battles with the gods, since there is a share for thee in the sacrifice, O fiery one!&ndash;for thee, the mighty showerer of gifts, whose Maruts the song of the offerer stream-like celebrates.&rsquo;</li>

<h2 id="29">29</h2>
<ol start="29">
<li>He then makes her say the text (Vāj. S.

<ol start="30">
<li>Having led her back (to her seat) the Pratiprasthātr̥ returns (to his place by the side of the southern altar). They now trim the fire <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>. When the fire has been trimmed, both (the Adhvaryu and Pratiprasthātr̥) make the second libation (of butter). Thereupon the Adhvaryu, having called (on the Āgnīdhra) for the &lsquo;Śraushaṭ,&rsquo; chooses the Hotr̥. The chosen Hotr̥ then seats himself on the Hotr̥&rsquo;s seat beside the northern altar; and having seated himself, he urges (the Adhvaryu and Pratiprasthātr̥) to proceed. Being thus urged to proceed, they both take up the spoons and step across (to the south side of the fires). After stepping across and calling for the &lsquo;Śraushaṭ,&rsquo; the Adhvaryu says (to the Hotr̥), &lsquo;Pronounce the offering-prayer on the kindling-sticks!&rsquo; and &lsquo;Pronounce the offering-prayer!&rsquo; at each (subsequent fore-offering). Pouring (the butter in the spoons) together (into the juhū) at the fourth <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>, they both proceed with the nine fore-offerings <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>.</li>

<h2 id="31">31</h2>

<li>Thus whatever has to be done by speech, that the Adhvaryu does, and not the Pratiprasthātr̥. Now as to why the Adhvaryu alone calls for the &lsquo;Śraushaṭ.&rsquo; Here indeed when the &lsquo;Vashaṭ&rsquo; is pronounced,</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="34">34</h2>
<ol start="34">
<li>The Pratiprasthātr̥ is merely the imitator of what is done (by the Adhvaryu). For Varuṇa is the nobility, and the Maruts are the people: hence he thereby makes the people the imitators, the followers of the nobility. But were the Pratiprasthātr̥ also to call for the &lsquo;Śraushaṭ,&rsquo; he would doubtless make the people equal in power to the nobility: for this reason the Pratiprasthātr̥ does not call for the &lsquo;Śraushaṭ.&rsquo;</li>

Now the reason why they make this exchange, is this,&ndash;Varuṇa is the nobility, and the male represents energy: hence they thereby bestow energy on the nobility. The female, on the other hand, is without energy; and the Maruts are the people: hence they thereby cause the people to be without energy. This is why they make this exchange.</li>

<p>392:1 For the performance of the Varuṇapraghāsāḥ the Adhvaryu and his assistant, the Pratiprasthātr̥, have to prepare,&ndash;to the east of the Āhavanīya, and at the distance of at least three steps (prakrama) from it,&ndash;two altars, separate from each other by about a span (of thumb and fore-finger), one south of the other. The northern one, belonging to the Adhvaryu, is to measure between four and five cubits along the west side, and between three and four cubits along the east side; the two sides being between six and eight cubits distant from each other. The southern altar, reserved for the Pratiprasthātr̥; is to be of the usual size of the altar at the haviryajñā. The ceremonies, detailed in I, 2, Brāhmaṇas 4 and 5, have to be performed also on the present occasion. In the middle of the east side of the northern altar a stake is fixed in the ground. On the north side of the northern altar, and contiguous with it, a pit (cātvāla), 1⅓ cubits (the length of the wedge) square, is dug, so as to be separated on the west from the utkara (heap of rubbish) by a narrow passage. With the mould dug up from the pit, the so-called uttara-vedi (upper or north altar) is raised on the northern altar, either of the same dimensions as the pit (1⅓ cubits square) or one third of the area of the northern altar, and so that the stake marks the middle of its east side. In the centre of this mound he makes a hollow (or &rsquo;navel&rsquo;), a span square; and the whole mound is then bestrewed with fine gravel. The texts used while tracing the sides of the pit, thrice throwing the wooden sword within the marked-off space, and raising the uttara-vedi, are given Vāj. S. V, 9-10. During the night the uttara-vedi remains covered with udumbara or plaksha branches or with sacrificial grass. Next morning the two fires for the newly-constructed fireplaces are taken from the Āhavanīya, either by dividing the latter into two equal parts, or by means of two bundles of firewood (threefold bound, see p. 389, note 1), lighted at it, and carried eastwards in a pan covered with sand or mould. While the fires, together with the lustral water and a spoonful of ghee, taken from the pot by five ladlings with the sruva, are taken eastward, the Hotr̥ thrice recites the verse &lsquo;Pra devyam deva,&rsquo; &amp;c.; and the Pratiprasthātr̥ draws, with the wooden sword, a line from the Āhavanīya to the south-west corner (or &lsquo;right hip&rsquo;) of the northern altar, or to the uttara-vedi. The Adhvaryu, standing between the two altars, then besprinkles the uttara-vedi with water, while muttering the  texts Vāj. S. V, II; whereupon he pours out on it crosswise the spoonful of clarified butter, with the texts V, 12; and lays, with the mantras V, 13, three enclosing-sticks (paridhi) of pītadāru wood round the &rsquo;navel&rsquo; (see I, 3, 4, 2 seq.), and puts bdellium, fragrant reed-grass, and the front-hair of a ram on the &rsquo;navel&rsquo; as a foundation (sambhāra, see II, 1, 1, 1 seq.) for the fire, which is then laid down thereon. On a hearth-mound (khara), a cubit square, formed on the southern altar, the Pratiprasthātr̥ also lays down his fire, after performing the usual fivefold lustration (see p. 2). Thereupon the praṇītā-water is brought forward in the way set forth at I, 1, 1, 12 seq. Kāty. V, 3, 9-4, 21. For a different mode of transferring the fire to the special fire-places, see p. 396, note 1.&#160;<a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

The Adhvaryu then takes the sacrificer by the arm and makes him enter the water. Thereupon he himself enters, strews sacrificial grass on the water, puts a stick on it, and thereon offers a spoonful of butter to Agni. Then follow six oblations, viz. four fore-offerings, performed in the usual way (the one to the Barhis being omitted);  an oblation of butter to Varuṇa, and another of the scrapings of curds to Agni and Varuṇa. Other authorities offer ten oblations instead of six, viz. four fore-offerings, two &lsquo;butter-portions&rsquo; to Agni and Soma, the two oblations to Varuṇa and Agni-Varuṇa, and two after-offerings. The Adhvaryu then immerses the butter-pot, with the text Vāj. S. III, 48. Thereupon the sacrificer and his wife bathe without diving, but wash each other&rsquo;s back.
