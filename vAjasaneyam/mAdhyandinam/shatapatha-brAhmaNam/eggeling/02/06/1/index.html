<li>Verily, by means of the Great Oblation the gods slew Vr̥tra, and gained that supreme authority which they now wield. And by means of the sacrifice to the fathers they then recalled to life those of them that had been slain in this battle; and they, indeed, were the fathers: hence the name Pitr̥yajña <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> (sacrifice to the Manes).</li>

<li>Now when he performs that sacrifice, he does so, hoping that thus they (the Asuras) will not slay any of his, or because the gods did so (perform it). Moreover he thereby offers to those (fathers) the share which the gods assigned to them; and thus he gratifies those whom the gods recalled to life, and leads his own fathers up to a better world; and whatever injury or loss he suffers through his own unrighteous conduct (or wrong sacrificial performance) <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> that is thereby made good to him: that is why he performs this sacrifice (to the fathers).</li>

<li>He offers a cake on six potsherds to the Pitaraḥ Somavantaḥ, or to Soma Pitr̥mat <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. Six doubtless are the seasons, and the fathers are the seasons: hence it is one of six potsherds.</li>

<ol start="5">
<li>Thereupon they parch barley-grain on the Anvāhāryapacana (or Dakshiṇāgni) for the Pitaro Barhishadaḥ <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>.

<li>Then a porridge is (prepared) for the Pitaro ’gnishvāttāḥ <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> (by the ground half of the parched grain) being mixed with the milk of a cow suckling an adopted calf, by stirring it once with a single splinter.

<h2 id="07">07</h2>
<ol start="7">
<li>Now those (fathers) who have sacrificed with Soma are the Pitaraḥ Somavantaḥ; and those who gain the world (of the gods) by means of cooked (sacrificial food) offered by them are the Pitaro Barhishadaḥ; and they who (have offered) neither the one nor the other, and whom Agni consumes by burning, they are the Pitaro ’gnishvāttāḥ.

<li>He takes out [the rice for] that cake of six potsherds, while seated behind the Gārhapatya, and looking southwards, with the sacrificial cord over his right shoulder. From thence he rises and</li>

<p>threshes (the rice), while standing north of the Dakshiṇa-fire, with his face towards the south. He cleans it but once <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>; since it is once for all that the fathers have departed.</p>

<li>He places the two mill-stones on (the black antelope skin, so as to be inclined) towards the south <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>; and puts the six potsherds on the south part of the Gārhapatya hearth.

<h2 id="10">10</h2>

<li>Thereupon he raises a square altar south of the Dakshiṇāgni <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>.

There are doubtless four intermediate quarters, and the fathers are the intermediate quarters: this is why he makes the corners point towards the intermediate quarters.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="11">11</h2>
<ol start="11">
<li>In the centre of this (altar) he lays down the fire. From the east, indeed, the gods came westwards to the men: hence one offers to them while standing</li>

<p>with his face towards the east. On all sides are the fathers, for the fathers are the intermediate regions, and the intermediate regions are indeed on all sides: this is why he lays down the fire in the centre.</p>

<li>From thence he throws the grass-bush (stambayajus) eastwards <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>. Having thrown away the grass-bush, he first encloses (the altar) thus (viz. on the west side), then thus (viz. on the north side), then thus (on the east side). Having enclosed it with the first line of enclosure, he (the Adhvaryu) draws (three) lines (across the altar) <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> and [the Āgnīdhra] removes (from them the dust) which has to be removed. In the same way he encloses it with the second line of enclosure; and having enclosed it with the second line of enclosure, and smoothed it down, he says, &lsquo;Place the sprinkling water on (the altar)!&rsquo; They accordingly place the sprinkling water on (the altar); and the firewood and barhis they lay down beside it <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>. He (the Āgnīdhra) wipes the spoons. He then walks up (to the altar) with the butter (and</li>

<p>puts it down thereon <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>, north of the sprinkling water).

<h2 id="13">13</h2>
<ol start="13">
<li>Here now they say, &lsquo;Let him take butter in the upabhr̥t (by) twice (ladling with the dipping spoon); since there are two after-offerings <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup> at this (sacrifice).&rsquo; Let him, nevertheless, ladle eight times into the upabhr̥t: let him do so, lest he should depart from the manner of the sacrifice.

<li>The Adhvaryu takes the lustral water, and sprinkles first the firewood, and then the altar <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>. Thereupon they hand the sacrificial grass <sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup> to him, and he puts it down (on the altar) with the knot to the east. Having thereupon sprinkled it and</li>
</ol>
<p>poured out (the lustral water on the lower ends of the grass-stalks), and untied the knot, he (at once) seizes the knot, not the prastara <sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>;&ndash;it is once for all that the fathers have departed: hence he does not take the prastara.</p>

<li>After undoing the band, he moves thrice <sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup> round from right to left, spreading the sacrificial grass all over (the altar); while spreading it all over from right to left in three layers, he reserves as much as may serve for the prastara-bunch. He then moves again thrice round (the altar) from left to right. The reason why he again moves thrice round from left to right, is that, while the first time he went away from here after those three ancestors of his, he now cones back again from them to this, his own world: that is why he again moves thrice round from left to right.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="16">16</h2>

<li>He lays the enclosing-sticks along (the fire, with their tops) towards the south <sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>; and the prastara also he spreads (with the grass-tops) towards the south; nor does he lay down the two vidhr̥tis between (the barhis and the prastara). Once for all the fathers have departed from hence: therefore he lays no vidhr̥tis between.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="17">17</h2>
<ol start="17">
<li>Thereon he lays the juhū, and east of it (on the barhis) the upabhr̥t. Having then put down the dhruvā, the cake, the parched grain, and the porridge (each east of the preceding one), he touches the oblations.</li>

He says, &lsquo;Hotr̥, seat thyself!&rsquo; and takes his seat. The Hotr̥, having sat down on the Hotr̥&rsquo;s seat, urges (the Adhvaryu) to proceed; and thus urged, the Adhvaryu takes the two spoons and steps across to the west (of the fire); and having stepped across and called for the &lsquo;Śraushaṭ,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;Pronounce the offering-prayer to the kindling-sticks!&rsquo; He performs four fore-offerings <sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>,</li>

<p>omitting the one to the Barhis; for the barhis means offspring, and he therefore performs the four fore-offerings without the one to the barhis, lest he should consign his offspring to the fathers.

<li>They all shift their sacrificial cord over to the right shoulder, being now about to proceed with those (chief) oblations. The Sacrificer and Brahman, (being) thus (invested), step across (from the west) to the east side, and the Āgnīdhra (from the east) to the west side (of the fire). And furthermore, the (Adhvaryu&rsquo;s) call for the &lsquo;Śraushaṭ&rsquo; is &lsquo;Õṁ svadhā!&rsquo; and the (Āgnīdhra&rsquo;s) response is &lsquo;Astu svadhā <sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup>!&rsquo; and the Vashat-call is &lsquo;Svadhā namaḥ!&rsquo;</li>

This he puts down at the same time (in the juhū); makes two sprinklings of butter thereon; and re-anoints (replenishes with butter, the parts of the sacrificial dishes from which he has made) the cuttings. He does not walk over (to the south side of the fire); but having risen and stepped up (to the fire) on the same side (where he was seated), and called (on the Āgnīdhra) for the &lsquo;Śraushaṭ,&rsquo; he says (to the Hotr̥), &lsquo;Pronounce the offering-prayer to the fathers, accompanied by Soma!&rsquo; and pours the oblation (into the fire) as soon as the Vashaṭ <sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup> has been uttered.</li>

<ol start="32">
<li>Now the reason why he does not walk across (to the ordinary place of offering), but pours out the oblation after stepping up (to the fire) on the sane side, is that the fathers have departed once for all; and the reason also, why he cuts but once from each of the sacrificial dishes, is that the fathers have departed once for all. And the reason why in making the cuttings, he keeps them together, is that the fathers are the seasons;&ndash;he thus keeps the seasons together, joins them to one another: that is why in making the cuttings, he keeps them together.</li>

<p>Brahman. The Brahman smells it and hands it to the Āgnīdhra; and the Āgnīdhra also smells it. And so indeed they do this. But, as from any other oblation they cut off the Ida and the fore-portion, so let them cut from this also; and having invoked it (the Iḍā) they smell it, but do not eat it. &lsquo;But,&rsquo; said Āsuri, &lsquo;we think that some should be eaten, of whatever is offered up in the fire.&rsquo;</p>
