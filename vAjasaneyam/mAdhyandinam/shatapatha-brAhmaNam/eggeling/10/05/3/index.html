<p>374:3 Sāyaṇa seems to take &lsquo;iva&rsquo; here in the sense of &rsquo;eva,&rsquo; as indeed it often has to be taken, especially in negative sentences.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>375:2 Sāyaṇa also allows the interpretation, &lsquo;after (its source, or cause,) the (supreme) self,&rsquo;&ndash;ātmānaṁ svakāraṇaṁ paramātmānaṁ svasvarūpaṁ vānvaickḥat. What seems, indeed, implied in these esoteric lucubrations, is that meditation on the infinite is equivalent to all ceremonial rites which are supposed to be incessantly performed for one so engaged, even during his sleep (paragraph 12).&#160;<a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

</li>
<li id="fn:6">
<p>375:5 Sāyaṇa here takes &lsquo;arka&rsquo; in the sense of &lsquo;arcanīya (worthy of veneration), as, indeed, he did several times before; though once he seems to call them &lsquo;agnyarkāḥ,&rsquo; as being the highest, merely speculative or immaterial form of sacrificial fires or fire-altars (dhyeyā agnayaḥ); cf. X, 3, 4, 3 seq.&ndash;The 36,000 fires are calculated so as to be equal to the number of days in the life of the perfect man living a hundred years (X, 2, 6, 9); there being thus for each day of his life a (spiritual) sacrificial fire, a mental exercise or discipline, as Sāyaṇa expresses it,&ndash;tatraikasmin dine (āgneyā?) manovr̥ttiḥ.&#160;<a href="#fnref:6" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>375:6 The text has everywhere the instrumental &lsquo;manasā,&rsquo; which would imply either the agent, the instrument, or the material, as the case might be.&#160;<a href="#fnref:7" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:8">
<p>376:1 That is, the ceremonies of Agnyādhāna (establishment of the sacrificial fire) and Agnicayana (building of the fire-altar) were performed by means of these fires. Sāyaṇa remarks that these rites were performed by the same &lsquo;beings (bhūtāni),&rsquo; which are mentioned immediately after, as would, indeed, appear to be the case from paragraph 12.&#160;<a href="#fnref:8" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>379:1 Sāyaṇa explains &lsquo;saṁdegham annasaṁdeham&rsquo; by &lsquo;annaprāṇāśrayaṁ śarīram,&rsquo;&ndash;svayam asaṁdeham aśarīraṁ sat karma prāṇānnayor anyonyasāhacaryād abhivr̥ddhiṁ vyatirekam makhyenāha, akr̥tsnam &amp;c.
