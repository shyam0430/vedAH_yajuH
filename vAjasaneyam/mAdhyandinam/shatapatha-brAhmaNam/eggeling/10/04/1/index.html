<p>344:3 Sāyaṇa takes this as intended to explain the &lsquo;in both&rsquo; ways&rsquo; of the quotation, viz. in regard to &lsquo;śrī&rsquo; (social distinction) on the one hand, and to &lsquo;yaśas&rsquo; (fame) and food (material prosperity) on the other. There is, however, nothing in the text to favour any such grouping of the distinctive objects of aspiration associated with the three classes (varṇatrayātmakatvam upajivya karmaṇaḥ, śrīyaśonnādalakshaṇaṁ phalam. Sāyaṇa), or with men generally (cf. Aitareyār. I, 4, 2, 10). Perhaps it means both in an intellectual and material point of view. The Syāparṇas seem to have been a rather self-assertive family of priests. The Aitareya Brāhmaṇa tells the following story about them (VII, 27):&ndash;Viśvantara Saushadmana, setting aside the Śyāparṇas, got up a sacrifice without them. The Syāparṇas, becoming aware of this, came to the sacrifice and sat them down inside the sacrificial ground. On seeing them, Viśvantara said, &lsquo;There sit those doers of evil deeds, those speakers of foul language, the Syāparṇas: turn them out let them not sit inside my sacrificial ground!&rsquo;&ndash;&lsquo;So be it!&rsquo; they said, and  turned them out. In being turned out, they cried aloud, &lsquo;At a sacrifice of Janamejaya, son of Parikshit, performed without the Kaśyapas, the Asitamr̥gas from amongst the Kaśyapas won the Soma-drink from the Bhūtavīras (who were officiating). In them they had heroic men on their side: what hero is there amongst us who will win that Soma-drink?&rsquo;&ndash;&lsquo;Here is that hero of yours,&rsquo; said Rāma Mārgaveya. Rāma Mārgaveya was a Śyāparṇīya, learned in sacred lore. When they rose to leave, he said, &lsquo;O king, will they turn out of the sacrificial ground even one so learned as me?&rsquo;&ndash;&lsquo;Whoever thou art, what knowest thou, vile Brāhman?&rsquo;&ndash;&lsquo;When the gods turned Indra away because he had outraged Tvashṭr̥&rsquo;s son Viśvarūpa, and laid low Vr̥tra, and thrown devotees before the jackals, and slain the Arurmaghas, and retorted on Br̥haspati (the teacher of the gods)&ndash;then Indra was deprived of the Soma-cup; and along with him the Kshatriyas were deprived of the Soma-cup. By stealing the Soma from Tvashṭr̥, Indra obtained a share in the Soma-cup, but to this day the Kshatriyas are deprived of the Soma-cup: how can they turn out from the sacrificial ground one who knows how the Kshatriya race can be put in possession of the Soma-cup from which they are deprived?&rsquo;&ndash;&lsquo;Knowest thou (how to procure) that drink, O Brāhman?&rsquo;&ndash;&lsquo;I know it indeed.&rsquo;&ndash;&lsquo;Tell us then, O Brahman?&rsquo;&ndash;&lsquo;To thee, O king, I will tell it,&rsquo; he said. Ultimately the Śyāparṇas are reinstated in their sacrificial duties. Cf. R. Roth, Zur Litteratur and Geschichte des Weda, p. 118. At VI, 2, I, 39, Syāparṇa Sāyakāyana was stated to have been the last who was in the habit of immolating five victims instead of two, as became afterwards the custom.&#160;<a href="#fnref:10" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
