<h2 id="04">04</h2>
<ol start="4">

This triplet then is honey (madhu); and honey being life-sap, it is life-sap he thus puts into him (Agni). With three Gāyatrī verses (he performs): the significance of this has been explained.</li>

<h2 id="05">05</h2>
<ol start="5">
<li>And as to its being called &lsquo;kūrma&rsquo; (tortoise);Prajāpati, having assumed that form, created living beings. Now what he created, he made; and inasmuch as he made (kar), he is (called) &lsquo;kūrma;&rsquo; and &lsquo;kūrma&rsquo; being (the same as) &lsquo;kaśyapa&rsquo; (a tortoise), therefore all creatures are said to be descended from Kaśyapa.</li>

<li>Now this tortoise is the same as yonder sun: it is yonder sun he thus lays down (on the altar). He lays it down in front with the head towards the back (west): he thus places yonder sun in the east</li>
</ol>
<p>looking thitherwards (or moving westward); and hence yonder sun is placed in the east looking thitherwards. On the right (south) of the Ashāḍḥā (he places it), for the tortoise (kūrma, masc.) is a male, and the Ashāḍḥā a female, and the male lies on the right side of the female;&ndash;at a cubit&rsquo;s distance <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, for at a cubit&rsquo;s distance the male lies by the female.

<h2 id="07">07</h2>
<ol start="7">
<li>And, again, why he puts down a tortoise;&ndash;the tortoise (kūrma) is the breath, for the breath makes (kar) all these creatures: it is breath he thus puts into him (Agni). He puts it down in front looking towards the back: he thus puts in the breath in front tending towards the back; whence the breath is taken in from the front backwards. [He puts it down so as to be] turned towards the (gold) man: he thus puts breath into the Sacrificer. South of the Ashāḍḥā (he puts it), for the tortoise is breath, and the Ashāḍḥā speech; and the breath (prāṇa, masc.) is the male, the mate, of speech (vāc, fem.).</li>

<ol start="11">
<li>With three (formulas) he puts it on (the altar);&ndash;three are these worlds, and threefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus puts it on. With three (formulas) he anoints it; that makes six: the significance of this (number) has been explained. There are avakā-plants <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> below and avakā-plants above (the</li>

<p>tortoise),&ndash;the avakā-plant means water: he thus places it in the midst of water. Having &lsquo;settled&rsquo; it, he pronounces the Sūdadohas upon it: the significance of this has been explained.</p>
<h2 id="12">12</h2>
<ol start="12">
<li>He then puts down a mortar and pestle. Vishṇu desired, &lsquo;May I be an eater of food!&rsquo; He saw these two bricks, the mortar and pestle. He placed them on (the altar); and by placing them thereon, he became an eater of food. In like manner, when the Sacrificer now places a mortar and pestle thereon, (he does so) thinking, &lsquo;I want to be an eater of food by the same means (rūpa), by performing the same rite by which Vishṇu became an eater of food.&rsquo; Now the mortar and pestle mean all (kinds of) food; for by the mortar and pestle food is prepared, and by means of them it is eaten.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="13">13</h2>

<li>He puts them down at the distance of the two retaḥsic <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>,&ndash;the retaḥsic being the ribs, and the ribs being the middle: he thus puts food into the middle of him (Agni);&ndash;on the north (upper) side (of the central brick): he thus puts the food upon him;&ndash;at the distance of a cubit, for from a cubit&rsquo;s distance food is (taken by the hand and) eaten.</li>

<h2 id="14">14</h2>
<ol start="14">
<li>They measure a span, for Vishṇu, when an embryo, was a span long; and these (mortar and pestle) being food, he thus puts food into him (Agni-Vishṇu) proportionate to his body. And indeed the food which is proportionate to the body satisfies,</li>
</ol>
<p>and does no harm; but that which is excessive does harm; and that which is too little does not satisfy.</p>
<h2 id="15">15</h2>
<ol start="15">
<li>They are made of Udumbara wood;&ndash;the Udumbara (ficus glomerata) being strength, life-sap, he thus puts strength, life-sap into him. And, again, the Udumbara being all the trees, by putting on those two, he puts all trees on (the altar). At the distance of the two retaḥsic (bricks, he places the mortar and pestle),&ndash;the &lsquo;seed-shedders&rsquo; being these two (worlds <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>), he thus puts the trees in these two (worlds), and hence there are trees in these two (worlds).

<ol start="16">
<li>And, again, why he places a mortar and pestle thereon. From Prajāpati, when relaxed, the breath wanted to go out from within. He kept it back by means of food: hence the breath is kept back by food, for he who eats food, breathes.</li>

<li>Those (energies) thus were kept back by one another. Having kept them back by one another, he (Prajāpati) caused them to enter his own self; and that food having entered, all the gods entered along with it; for everything here lives on food.</li>

The pestle is the śiśna; it is round-like, for the śiśna is round-like. He places it to the right (south of the mortar), for the male lies on the right side of the female. And what food there is for the consecrated animal, that is the dūrvā-brick. The left (north) side of that (Agni or altar) is more raised,&ndash;that Agni is an animal, and hence the left side of the belly of a well-filled beast is more raised (than the right side).</li>

<p>393:1 The mortar and pestle are to be placed as far north of the central (naturally-perforated) brick, as the two retaḥsic lie in front (towards the east) of it.

<p>397:2 ? Or, of it (the fire-pan). There is some uncertainty regarding this item of the ceremonial. Kātyāyana&rsquo;s rule (XVII, 5, 4)&ndash;&lsquo;Having placed the Ukhā (pan) on the mortar, pounded the remainder of clay, and thrown it down in front, with the text &ldquo;Dhruvā asi,&rdquo; (of) the Ukhā&rsquo;&ndash;is evidently intentionally vague. Mahīdhara (on Vāj. S. XIII, 34) gives the following interpretation of it,&ndash;&lsquo;Having first silently placed the Ukhā on the mortar, then pounded the remaining clay, and thrown it down on the ground in front of the Ukhā, let him place the Ukhā thereon with two formulas.&rsquo; According to this, the Ukhā would only temporarily be placed on the mortar, its proper and permanent place (loka) being on the powdered clay in front (to the east) of the mortar. The text of the Brāhmaṇa, as it stands, however, cannot possibly be construed so as to accord with Mahīdhara&rsquo;s interpretation. This would require some such reading as,&ndash;athopaśayām pishṭvā, purastād ukhāyā upanivapya lokabhājam ukhām karoti. See, however, paragraph 38 below, which evidently applies to the permanent position of the pan.&#160;<a href="#fnref:10" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
