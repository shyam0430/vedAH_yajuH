<li>And as to why (he puts the heads) in the fire-pan;&ndash;the fire-pan being a womb, and the heads of the victims being animals, he thus establishes the animals in the womb: hence animals, though being eaten and cooked, do not diminish, for he establishes them in the womb.</li>

<li>Now the same thing which the gods did is done here.

<li>Seven (chips) he thrusts into each,&ndash;seven vital airs there are in the head: these he thereby puts into it. And if there are five victims, let him thrust in five times seven (chips); for those five victims he puts on (the fire-pan), and there are seven vital</li>

<li>Having stepped on the altar and walked round behind the naturally-perforated (brick), he lays down the Apasyāḥ (water-bricks);&ndash;now the Apasyāḥ are the same as water, and the water has gone out of these victims: he thus puts water into these victims, when he lays down the Apasyāḥ (bricks). He lays them down close to the (heads of the) animals: he thereby puts the water together with the animals. He lays down five (bricks) in each quarter, for five are those victims. He lays them down in every (quarter): everywhere he thus puts water into them.</li>

<h2 id="41">41</h2>
<ol start="41">
<li>Now the first fifteen are the Apasyāḥ,&ndash;water is a thunderbolt, and the thunderbolt is fifteenfold;&ndash;hence wherever the waters flow, there they destroy evil; and verily the thunderbolt destroys the evil of this place: hence, when it rains one should go about uncovered, thinking, &lsquo;May that thunderbolt remove evil from me!&rsquo;</li>

<li>And the last five are the Cḥandasyāḥ (the metres’ bricks);&ndash;the metres are cattle, and cattle is food; or rather the flesh of cattle is food, and the flesh has departed from these victims: he therefore puts flesh on those cattle when he lays down the Cḥandasyāḥ. He places them close to the victims: he thereby puts the flesh close to the (bones of the) cattle. The Apasyāḥ are inside, the Cḥandasyāḥ outside; for the water is inside, and the flesh outside.</li>

Or, again, those goats’ hair which are in the fire-pan <sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>, they are hair.

<ol start="44">
<li>And, again, why he lays down the Apasyāḥ. When Prajāpati was disjointed the water went from him; that being gone, he sank down; and because he sank down (viś), therefore there are twenty (viṁśati, viz. such bricks). It flowed from his fingers,&ndash;the fingers being the end, it (the water) went from him in the end.</li>
