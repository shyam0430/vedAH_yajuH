<li>Being about to build Agni (the fire-altar), he takes him up into his own self; for from out of his own self he causes him to be born, and wherefrom one is born, suchlike he becomes. Now were he to build up Agni without taking him up into his own self, he would beget man from man, mortal from mortal, one not freed from sin from one not freed from sin; but when he builds up Agni after taking him up into his own self, he causes Agni to be born from Agni, the immortal from the immortal, the sinless from the sinless.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="02">02</h2>
<ol start="2">
<li>He takes him in (by muttering, Vāj. S. X III, 1), &lsquo;Within me I first take Agni,&rsquo; he thereby first takes Agni into his own self;&ndash;&lsquo;for increase of wealth, for healthy progeny, for vigorous manhood!&rsquo; and hereby he takes all blessings to himself;&ndash;&lsquo;and may the deities stand by me!&rsquo; and hereby he takes all the gods to himself; and thus he takes into his own self all that he is about to generate from his own self. Having taken Agni</li>
</ol>
<p>into his own self whilst standing, he builds him up sitting;&ndash;Agni is an animal: hence the animal, having received the foetus standing, gives birth after lying down.</p>
<h2 id="03">03</h2>
<ol start="3">
<li>He now sings the Satya Sāman <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> (true hymn). For the gods then said, &lsquo;Let us make the truth (satya) his mouth (or beginning): thus we shall become the truth, truth will turn unto us, and true will become that wish of ours for which we are about to perform this rite!&rsquo;</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="04">04</h2>
<ol start="4">
<li>They sang that &rsquo;true hymn&rsquo; at the outset, and thus made the truth his (Agni&rsquo;s) mouth; and they became the truth; the truth turned unto them, and true became that wish of theirs for which they performed this rite.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="05">05</h2>
<ol start="5">
<li>And in like manner when the Sacrificer now, at the outset, sings the &rsquo;true hymn,&rsquo; he thereby makes the truth his (Agni&rsquo;s) mouth; and he (himself) becomes the truth; and truth turns unto him; and true becomes that wish of his for which he performs this rite.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="06">06</h2>
<ol start="6">
<li>Now that truth is the same as the waters, for the waters are the truth. Hence they say, &lsquo;Whereby <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> the waters flow, that is a form of the truth.&rsquo; It is the waters indeed that were made first of this universe: hence when the waters (rains) flow, then everything whatsoever exists is produced here.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="07">07</h2>
<ol start="7">
<li>He then puts down a lotus-leaf (in the centre of</li>
</ol>
<p>the altar-site);&ndash;the lotus-leaf is a womb: he hereby puts a womb to it (for Agni to be born from).</p>
<h2 id="08">08</h2>
<ol start="8">
<li>And, again, why he puts down a lotus-leaf;&ndash;the lotus means the waters, and this earth is a leaf thereof: even as the lotus-leaf here lies spread on the water, so this earth lies spread on the waters. Now this same earth is Agni&rsquo;s womb, for Agni (the fire-altar) is this earth, since thereof the whole Agni is built up: it is this earth he thus lays down. He lays it down so as not to be separated from the truth: he thereby establishes this earth on the truth;&ndash;hence this earth is established on the truth; and hence the truth is this earth, for this earth is the most certain of these worlds.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="09">09</h2>
<ol start="9">
<li>[He lays it down, with Vāj. S. XIII, 2] &lsquo;The waters’ back thou art, the womb of Agni,&rsquo; for this earth is indeed the back of the waters, and the womb of Agni;&ndash;&lsquo;around the swelling ocean,&rsquo; for the ocean indeed swells around this earth;&ndash;&lsquo;growing great on the lotus,&rsquo; that is, &lsquo;growing, flourish thou on the lotus;&rsquo;&ndash;&lsquo;spread out with the extent, with the breadth, of the sky!&rsquo; with this he strokes along (the leaf),&ndash;for this Agni is yonder sun, and no other extent but that of the sky is able to contain him: he thus says (to the leaf), Having become the sky, contain him! He lays it down with a Svarāj verse, for self-rule (svārājya) belongs to the waters. Having &lsquo;settled&rsquo; it, he pronounces the Sūdadohas <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> upon it: the significance of this has been explained.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="10">10</h2>
<ol start="10">
<li>He then puts the gold plate <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> thereon. Now</li>
</ol>
<p>this gold plate is yonder sun, for he shines over all the creatures here on earth; and &lsquo;rocas&rsquo; (shine) they mystically call &lsquo;rukma&rsquo; (gold plate), for the gods love the mystic: he thus lays down yonder sun (on the altar). It is golden, and round, with one and twenty knobs,&ndash;the significance of this has been explained. He puts it down with the knobs pointing downward; for the knobs are his (the sun&rsquo;s) rays, and his rays (shine) downwards.</p>
<h2 id="11">11</h2>
<ol start="11">
<li>He puts it down on the lotus-leaf;&ndash;the lotus-leaf is a womb: in the womb he thus places him (Agni).</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="12">12</h2>
<ol start="12">
<li>And, again, why he puts it on the lotus-leaf;&ndash;the lotus-leaf is a foundation, for the lotus-leaf is this earth, and this earth is the foundation: he who is not settled on this earth, is unsettled even as one who is far away. Now by means of his rays that (sun) is settled on this earth: he thus settles him (Agni) on this earth, as his foundation.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="13">13</h2>
<ol start="13">
<li>And, again, why he puts it on the lotus-leaf. When Indra had smitten Vr̥tra, he, thinking that he had not laid him low, entered the waters. He said to them, &lsquo;I am afraid: make ye a stronghold for me!&rsquo; Now what essence of the waters there was that they gathered upwards (on the surface), and made it a stronghold for him; and because they made (kar) a stronghold (pūḥ) for him, therefore it is &lsquo;pūshkara;&rsquo; &lsquo;pūshkara&rsquo; being what is mystically called &lsquo;push-kara&rsquo; (lotus-leaf), for the gods love the mystic. Now when he puts it (the gold plate) on the lotus-leaf, he then establishes him (Agni) in that essence which the waters gathered together for him (Indra), and in that stronghold which they made for him.</li>

<li>[He puts it down, with Vāj. S. XIII, 3]</li>

<p>&lsquo;The Brahman first born in front;&rsquo; the Brahman doubtless is yonder sun, and he is born day by day in front (in the east);&ndash;&lsquo;from the summit <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> he, the longing, overspread the shining,&rsquo; the summit doubtless is the middle, the shining ones are these worlds, and the longing one is yonder sun,&ndash;he is the longing one inasmuch as he longed to be born; and in rising he overspreads <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> these (worlds) from the summit, from the middle;&ndash;&lsquo;he (overspread) the nighest extents of the deep,&rsquo; his nighest extents of the deep doubtless are the regions, for he (the sun) does extend nigh to them;&ndash;&rsquo;the womb of the existent and of the non-existent did he overspread!&rsquo; the womb of the existent and of the non-existent doubtless are these worlds; for both what exists and what does not exist is born from these worlds. He puts it on with a trishṭubh verse, for yonder (sun) is related to the Trishṭubh <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. Having &lsquo;settled&rsquo; it, he pronounces the Sūdadohas <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> verse upon it: the significance of this has been explained.</p>
<h2 id="15">15</h2>
<ol start="15">
<li>He then lays the (gold) man thereon,&ndash;he is Prajāpati, he is Agni, he is the Sacrificer. He is made of gold, for gold is light, and fire is light; gold is immortality, and fire is immortality. It is a man (purusha), for Prajāpati is the Man.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="16">16</h2>
<ol start="16">
<li>And, again, why he lays down the man. When Prajāpati was relaxed, his pleasing form went out from within; when it had gone out of him, the gods left him. When the gods restored him, they put that pleasing form into him, and the gods were pleased with that (form) of his; and inasmuch as the gods were pleased (ram) with that pleasing (ramya) form of his, it is called &lsquo;hiramya;&rsquo; &lsquo;hiramya&rsquo; being what is mystically called &lsquo;hiraṇya&rsquo; (gold), for the gods love the mystic. And in like manner does this (Sacrificer) now put that pleasing form into him (Agni), and the gods are pleased with that (form) of his. But that pleasing form of his is the vital air: it is that vital air he thus puts into him.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="17">17</h2>
<ol start="17">
<li>He lays him on the gold plate, for the gold plate is yonder sun: that same man who is in that (sun&rsquo;s) disk, it is him he now lays down (on the altar).</li>

<ol start="18">
<li>He lays him down on his back <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>;&ndash;for the gods at that time said, &lsquo;If we lay down these two <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> both looking hitherwards, they will burn up everything here; and if (we lay) both so as to be turned away from here, they will give warmth only in the opposite direction; and if facing each other, then there will be light only between those two, and they will injure each other.&rsquo; They laid down the one so as to look hitherwards, and the other so as to look away from here: that one (the sun), the gold disk, looking downwards, gives warmth by his rays, and</li>
</ol>
<p>that man (tends) upward by his vital airs <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>. He lays him down (with the head) towards the east, for (with the head) towards the east this Agni (the fire-altar) is built up.</p>
<h2 id="19">19</h2>
<ol start="19">
<li>[He lays him down, with Vāj. S. XIII, 4; R̥k S.

<h2 id="24">24</h2>
<ol start="24">
<li>Whilst meditating, they saw this Sāman, and sang it, and thereby put vigour into him; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer) thereby put it into him: he sings on the man, he puts vigour into the man;&ndash;he sings on the bright one <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>, for Agni is all bright things.

<ol start="25">
<li>He (the Sacrificer) then stands by (the gold man) worshipping him with the Sarpanāma (serpent-named) formulas. The serpents doubtless are these worlds, for these glide along (sarp) with everything here whatsoever there is; and Agni is no other than the self (body) of all the gods.

<li>They saw those Sarpanāma and worshipped with them; by these (verses) they stopped these worlds for him, and caused them to bend themselves; and because they caused them to bend (nam) themselves,</li>

<p>therefore (the formulas are called) Sarpanāma. And in like manner does the Sacrificer, when he stands by worshipping with the Sarpanāma formulas, stop these worlds for him, and cause these worlds to bend themselves; and so they do not glide away with that self of his.</p>
<h2 id="27">27</h2>
<ol start="27">
<li>And, again, why he stands by worshipping with the Sarpanāma formulas;&ndash;the serpents are these worlds, for whatever creeps (sarp), creeps in these worlds.

<p>that (leads) to the gods. Thereupon, going back, (he offers) while sitting behind, with his face towards the east; and in this way that performance of his takes place towards the east <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>.</p>

And in like manner the Sacrificer, having by that tree repelled the Rakshas, the fiends, on the south, now spreads that sacrifice in a place free from danger and devilry.

<li>And, again, why he lays down two offering-spoons. When Prajāpati was relaxed, Agni took his (Prajāpati&rsquo;s) fiery spirit, and carried it off to the south, and there stopped; and because after carrying (karsh) it off he stopped (ud-ram), therefore the Kārshmarya (sprang up). And Indra took his (Prajāpati&rsquo;s) vigour and went away to the north: it became the Udumbara tree.</li>

<li>He (Prajāpati) said to those two, &lsquo;Come ye to me, and put back into me that (substance) of mine wherewith ye have gone off!&rsquo;&ndash;&lsquo;Well then, bestow thou all food here on us two!&rsquo; they said.&ndash;&lsquo;Well then, join me, becoming these two arms of mine!&rsquo;&ndash;&lsquo;So be it!&rsquo; He bestowed all food on them, and they joined him, becoming those two arms of his: hence it is by the arms that food is made, and by means of the arms that it is eaten, for he (Prajāpati) bestowed all food on the two arms.</li>

With a Gāyatrī verse (he performs),&ndash;Agni is Gāyatra: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus lays down that (spoon).

And as to its being a verse addressed to Agni, it is because it is the performance of Agni (the fire-altar);&ndash;and a trishṭubh one, because Indra is connected with the Trishṭubh; and Agni includes Indra and Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus lays it down. Moreover, all the gods are Indra and Agni, and Agni belongs to all the deities: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus lays it down.

Moreover, those two (arms of Agni) are wings; and whatever forms, whatever stomas, whatever pr̥shṭḥas, whatever metres he will be applying to that fire-altar, that will be the perfection, that will be the growth of those two: let him therefore make arms to that (gold) man.</li>

<p>375:1 There seems to be considerable difference of opinion between Kātyāyana and Sāyaṇa regarding this point of the ceremonial. The gold man lies stretched out on his back with his head towards the east. According to Kātyāyana, XVII, 4, 10, he (the Sacrificer) is to lie down so as to cover the gold man, but without actually touching him with his breast, and at the extreme end of where the arms touch (the ground) he is to make two marks, where the spoons are then to be laid down with the bowl towards the east. Sāyaṇa,  on the other hand, explains&ndash;&lsquo;Let the Adhvaryu lay down the two spoons close to the breast of the laid-down gold man. Having beheld (i.e. recognised)&ndash;or, whilst beholding (?)&ndash;that man, where-ever the laid-down pair of spoons reaches his breast there, having made a mark, let him lay down the two spoons: that part of the breast doubtless is the place of those two (spoons, or gods?) extolled as the arms.&rsquo; Perhaps the text of this comment is somewhat corrupt. The ceremony is apparently intended to symbolise the identification of the Sacrificer with the sacrificial man, or the sacrifice itself: The Sacrificer lies down so as to rest on his forearms; the spoons being afterwards laid down on the marks left by the fore-arms (and naturally running in an easterly direction).&ndash;For Professor Weber&rsquo;s view, see p. 367, note 1.&#160;<a href="#fnref:16" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
