That (dūrvā grass) is the ruling power (Kshatra), for it is this vital sap, the breath; and the other plants are the hair: in laying down that (dūrvā plant) he lays down all (kinds of) plants.</li>

With two (verses) he puts it on: the meaning of this has been explained. Having &lsquo;settled&rsquo; it, he pronounces the Sūdadohas upon it: the meaning of this has been explained.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="16">16</h2>
<ol start="16">
<li>He then puts down a Dviyajus <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> (brick). Indra and Agni desired, &lsquo;May we go to the heavenly world!&rsquo; They saw that dviyajus brick, even this earth, and laid it down; and having laid it down, they went to the heavenly world from that foundation. In like manner when this Sacrificer lays down a dviyajus (brick), (he does so) thinking, &lsquo;I want to go to the heavenly world by the same means (rūpa), by performing the same rite by which Indra and Agni went to the heavenly world!&rsquo; And as to its being called &lsquo;dviyajus,&rsquo; it is because two deities saw it. And as to why he lays down a dviyajus one: the dviyajus doubtless is the Sacrificer.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="17">17</h2>
<ol start="17">
<li>Here now they say, &lsquo;If (the dviyajus) is that same Sacrificer who is that gold man, which then is that (real) form of his?&rsquo; Well, that (gold man) is his divine body, and this (brick) is his human one. As to that gold man, that is his immortal form, his divine form; gold being immortal. And as to this (brick) being made of clay, it is because this is his human form.</li>

<li>And were he not to put it on after (the gold man), he assuredly would not afterwards find out that divine body <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>; but now that he puts it on thereafter, he does so afterwards find out that divine body. He lays it down close to the dūrvā-brick the dūrvā-brick being cattle, he thus establishes the Sacrificer in (the possession of) cattle.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="20">20</h2>
<ol start="20">
<li>Here now they say, &lsquo;How do those two bodies of his come to be connected together by the breath, and not severed?&rsquo; Well, the naturally-perforated (brick) is the breath, and the dūrvā-brick is the breath, and the dviyajus (-brick) is the Sacrificer:</li>
</ol>
<p>and inasmuch as he lays down the dūrvā-brick close to the naturally-perforated one, he thereby connects and joins breath with breath; and inasmuch as he lays down the dviyajus one close to the dūrvā-brick&ndash;the dūrvā-brick being the breath, and the dviyajus the Sacrificer&ndash;those two bodies of his (the human one and the divine one) thus become connected together by the breath, and not severed.</p>

With two (verses) he lays it down: the significance of this has been explained. And, moreover, it is because that material form (of the brick) is a twofold one, (consisting as it does of) clay and water. Having &lsquo;settled&rsquo; it, he pronounces the Sūdadohas upon it: the significance of this has been explained.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="22">22</h2>
<ol start="22">
<li>He then lays down two Retaḥsic (seed-shedding bricks);&ndash;the seed-shedders doubtless are these two worlds, for these two worlds do shed seed;&ndash;this (terrestrial world) sheds seed upwards from here (in the form of) smoke; it becomes rain in yonder world, and that rain yonder world (sheds) from above: hence (creatures) are born within these two worlds, and therefore these two worlds are seed-shedders.</li>

He lays them down separately, for separate are these testicles. He &lsquo;settles&rsquo; them once: he thereby makes them one and the same, whence they have a common connecting-part. He lays them down close to the dviyajus (brick) <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>: the dviyajus being the Sacrificer, he thus puts the testicles together with the Sacrificer.</li>

<p>is all the light in this (terrestrial) world: it is Agni he thus lays down. He lays it down close to the seed-shedding ones,&ndash;the seed-shedding ones being these two worlds, he thus places Agni together with these two worlds. He lays it down between (the two Retaḥsic <sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>), for Agni (the fire) is within these two worlds.</p>
<h2 id="26">26</h2>
<ol start="26">
<li>And, again, why he lays down an &lsquo;all-light&rsquo; (brick);&ndash;the &lsquo;all-light&rsquo; (brick) is progeny, for progeny is all the light: he thus lays generative power (into Agni). He lays it down so as not to be separated from the seed-shedding (bricks),&ndash;the seed-shedders being the testicles, he thus makes the generative power inseparable from the testicles.

<li>This earth is the bearer of what is desirable; for&ndash;the desirable being the vital airs&ndash;this earth bears everything that breathes, and for that reason this earth is the bearer of what is desirable. But</li>
</ol>
<p>speech (the mouth) also indeed is the bearer of what is desirable; for the desirable is the vital airs, and for the (channels of) the vital airs food is put into the mouth: therefore speech is the bearer of what is desirable.</p>
<h2 id="36">36</h2>
<ol start="36">
<li>Now the Ashāḍḥā is the same as those vital airs; he lays it down in the fore-part (of the altar): he thus bestows (on Agni the organs of) the vital airs in front; whence there are here (organs of) the vital airs in front (of the body). Let him not in this layer enclose this (Ashāḍḥā) in front by any other brick which has a special prayer of its own, lest he close up (the organs of) the vital airs.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="37">37</h2>
<ol start="37">
<li>And as to why he lays down in front five Apasyās <sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>,&ndash;water (ap) is food, and by food (the organs of) the vital airs are not closed up. He lays down (the Ashāḍḥā) close to the two seasonal ones: he thereby establishes speech in the seasons, and hence speech (the mouth) speaks here, firmly established in the seasons.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="38">38</h2>
<ol start="38">
<li>Here now they say, &lsquo;If the Viśvajyotis (brick) is progeny, and the Ashāḍḥā speech, why does he put the two seasonal ones between them?&rsquo; Well, the seasonal ones being the year, he thus separates speech from progeny by the year, and hence children utter speech at the time (or age) of a year.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="39">39</h2>
<ol start="39">
<li>[He lays down the Ashāḍḥā, with Vāj. S. XIII, 26] &lsquo;Thou art Ashāḍḥā, the conquering,&rsquo; for the gods thereby conquered the Asuras,&ndash;&lsquo;conquer the enemies! conquer the hostile!&rsquo; as the text, so the meaning;&ndash;&rsquo;thou hast a thousand energies: do thou speed me!&rsquo; a thousand means</li>
</ol>
<p>all: thus, &rsquo;thou hast all energies, do thou speed me!&rsquo; When he has &lsquo;settled&rsquo; it, he pronounces the Sūdadohas on it: the significance of this has been explained.</p>
<h2 id="40">40</h2>
<ol start="40">
<li>Here now they say, &lsquo;Why are those other bricks placed in front of the naturally-perforated one?&rsquo; Let him say, There are two wombs (birthplaces)&ndash;the one being the womb of the gods, the other the womb of men: the gods have their birthplace in the east, and men in the west; and when he lays down those (bricks) in front, he thereby causes the Sacrificer to be born from the womb of the gods.</li>
