<li>And as to why he buys the king when the Gārhapatya is built, and the Āhavanīya unbuilt,&ndash;Agni is the body, and Soma the vital air: he thus places the vital air in the middle of the body, and hence that vital air is in the middle of the body.</li>

<ol start="8">
<li>And only on the Gārhapatya (site) he throws saline soil, not on the Āhavanīya; for the Gārhapatya is this (terrestrial) world, and saline soil means cattle: he thus bestows cattle on this world, whence there are cattle in this world.</li>

<p>scatters sand; for sand means seed, and in both (fire-altars) fashioning (of Agni) takes place: &lsquo;May he be fashioned from out of that seed!&rsquo; thus he thinks.</p>
<h2 id="10">10</h2>
<ol start="10">
<li>He scatters it with two different formulas; for the Gārhapatya is the world of men, and the Āhavanīya is the world of the gods, and different indeed are the divine and the human. With the longer formula he scatters it on the Āhavanīya, and with the shorter one on the Gārhapatya, for longer is the life of the gods, and shorter the life of men. On the Gārhapatya he scatters the sand before (the setting up of) the enclosing-stones; for sand is seed: &lsquo;May these be fashioned from out of that seed!&rsquo; thus he thinks.</li>

He now addresses the enclosing-stones on the Āhavanīya: the meaning of this has been explained <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. He then scatters sand: sand being seed, that seed of his is not shed aside, but is received also by that womb.</li>

<p>born in this world, is really intended to be born in the heavenly world: when he strokes (the sand) even on the Āhavanīya with two (verses) containing (the verb) &rsquo;to grow,&rsquo; and not on the Gārhapatya, he causes him to be born in the heavenly world.</p>

<li>From the front side he brings one, with (Vāj. S.

<li>Then (he fetches a clod) from the south, with (Vāj. S. XII, 103), &lsquo;Turn hither, O Earth, with</li>

<p>sacrifice, with milk!&rsquo; as the text, so the meaning;&ndash;&lsquo;Agni, sent forth, hath mounted thy skin;&rsquo; whatsoever is on this (earth) that is her skin; and that (skin) Agni mounts, when sent forth, when blazing forth. Having brought it he puts it on the body (of the altar) inside the junction of the (right) wing (and the body): he thereby puts into him (Agni) what vital sap had flowed from him in the southern direction, and also the southern region itself he bestows upon him.</p>

Let him not take it exactly from the back (west) lest he should take the vital sap from the path of the sacrifice: he takes it from about there <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>.</li>

Having brought that (clod), he puts it on the body (of the altar) on the middle of the junction of the (left) wing (and the body): he thereby puts into him (Agni) what vital sap flowed away in the northerly direction; and also the northern region itself he bestows upon him.</p>

<li>These same (clods) are the regions; he places them on all sides: he thus places the regions on all sides; whence the regions are on every side.

<ol start="26">
<li>As to this they say, &lsquo;How do these (clod-bricks) come to be put on as baked, as heated (burnt) ones?&rsquo; Well, these (clods) are vital sap, and the vital sap (blood) is naturally-heated; and, moreover, whatever comes in contact with Agni Vaiśvānara, even thereby comes to be put on as baked, as heated.</li>

<li>And as to why he scatters sand,&ndash;that Agni (fire-altar) is Prajāpati, and Prajāpati is the whole Brahman. Now that sand is (put) in (the place of) the lost part of the Brahman; and that part of it which has not been lost is this fire-altar which is now being built: thus when he scatters sand he restores to him that lost part of the Brahman. That (sand which) he scatters is unnumbered, unlimited; for who knows how great is that lost part of the Brahman? And verily he who, knowing this, scatters sand, restores the whole, complete Prajāpati.</li>
