<li>Being about to build the Gārhapatya (fire-place), he sweeps (its site) with a Palāśa (butea frondosa) branch. For when he builds the Gārhapatya <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> he settles on that place; and whatsoever builders of fire-altars (there have been), they are indeed settled on this earth; and when he sweeps (that place) he thereby sweeps away those settled (there before hire), thinking, &lsquo;Lest I should settle on those already settled (here).&rsquo;</li>

</ol>
<h2 id="04">04</h2>
<ol start="4">
<li>&lsquo;The Fathers have prepared this place for him!&rsquo; for Yama is the Kshatra (nobility, or ruling power), and the Fathers (deceased ancestors) are the clansmen; and to whomsoever the chief (kshatriya), with the approval of the clan, grants a settlement, that (settlement) is properly given: and in like manner does Yama, the ruling power, with the consent of the Fathers, the clan, now grant to this (Sacrificer) a settlement on this earth.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="05">05</h2>
<ol start="5">
<li>With a palāśa branch he sweeps; for the Palāśa tree is the Brahman <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>: it is by the Brahman he thus sweeps away those already settled;&ndash;with a prayer (he does so), for the prayer is the Brahman: it is by the Brahman he thus sweeps away those already settled.

<li>He then scatters saline soil (over the hearth-site); for the Gārhapatya is this world, and salt means cattle: he thus bestows cattle on this world,&ndash;hence those cattle here in this world.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="07">07</h2>
<ol start="7">
<li>And again why he scatters saline soil. Prajāpati created creatures; he created them with different kinds of amnions: they did not agree together. He desired, &lsquo;May they agree together!&rsquo; He made them to be of the same (kind of) amnion: hence even to this day, being of equal amnions, they agree together. And he who offers, offers thinking, &lsquo;May I be (born) with the same (kind of) amnion as the gods!&rsquo; and when he scatters saline salt (in the hearth-site) he thereby becomes of equal amnion with the gods.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="08">08</h2>
<ol start="8">

</ol>
<h2 id="09">09</h2>
<ol start="9">
<li>He then scatters sand to keep (the saline soil, or amnion) from being scorched <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>;&ndash;for sand is nothing else than the ashes of Agni Vaiśvānara, and him, Agni Vaiśvānara, he is indeed about to build up; and Agni does not scorch his own self.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="10">10</h2>
<ol start="10">
<li>And again why he scatters sand,&ndash;sand is nothing else than the seed of Agni Vaiśvānara <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>, and him, Agni Vaiśvānara, he is about to build up; but nothing is fashioned from out of the seedless: &lsquo;May he (Agni) be fashioned from out of this seed!&rsquo; so he thinks.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="11">11</h2>
<ol start="11">
<li>[He scatters it, with Vāj. S. XII, 46] &lsquo;Agni&rsquo;s ashes thou art! Agni&rsquo;s soil thou art!&rsquo; for Agni&rsquo;s ashes are useless, and the sand is not useless: he thus makes it (the Gārhapatya hearth) to be useful. He covers with it the whole Gārhapatya; for the</li>
</ol>
<p>Gārhapatya altar is the womb, and the sand is seed: he thus fills the whole womb with seed.</p>
<h2 id="12">12</h2>
<ol start="12">
<li>He then encloses it with enclosing-stones; for the enclosing-stones are the womb: he thus encloses the seed here cast in the womb; and hence the seed which is cast is enclosed in the womb.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="13">13</h2>
<ol start="13">
<li>And, again, why he encloses it with enclosing-stones;&ndash;the Gārhapatya hearth is this (terrestrial) world, and the enclosing-stones are the waters: he thus surrounds this world with water,&ndash;it is with the ocean that he thus surrounds it on all sides, and hence the ocean flows round this world on all sides. (He puts up the stones) by turning to the right (or south) <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>, whence the ocean flows round this world (from the east) southwards;&ndash;by means of a dug out (hole, or moat) <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>, whence the ocean flows round this world in a moat.</li>

He does not settle them, for unsettled are the waters; nor does he pronounce the Sūdadohas (verse) on them <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="15">15</h2>
<ol start="15">
<li>For the enclosing-stones are the bones, and the Sūdadohas is the breath; and there is no breath in the bones. With one and the same formula he lays down many bricks <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>, for of one and the same form are the waters; and as to there being many enclosing-stones, it is because there are many waters.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="16">16</h2>
<ol start="16">
<li>The enclosing-stones, then, are the womb; the saline earth is the amnion, and the sand is the seed. The enclosing-stones are outside, and the saline earth is inside; for the womb is outside, and the amnion inside. The saline earth is outside, and the sand inside; for the amnion is outside, and the seed inside. He who is born is born from these: it is from them that he thus causes him (Agni) to be born.</li>

<ol start="17">
<li>Thereon he now builds it (the hearth): he</li>

Now the four which he puts on running eastwards are the body; and as to there being four of these, it is because this body (of ours) consists, of four parts <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>. The two at the back then are the thighs; and the two in front the arms; and where the body is that (includes) the head.</li>

<h2 id="19">19</h2>
<ol start="19">
<li>Now he here fashions him (Agni) with wings and tail; for whatlike the seed is fashioned in the womb suchlike (offspring) is born: thus inasmuch as he now fashions him with wings and tail, he is born hereafter <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup> with wings and tail.</li>

<li>While being indeed furnished with wings and tail, people do not see him as one having wings and tail <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>: hence one does not see the child in the womb in its proper shape; but hereafter they (will) see him as one having wings and tail, and hence one sees the child after it is born in its proper shape.</li>
