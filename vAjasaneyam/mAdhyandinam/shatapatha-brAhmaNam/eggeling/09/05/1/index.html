<li>Two he offers of the fire-altar,&ndash;two-footed is the Sacrificer, and Agni is the Sacrificer: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus completes the sacrifice.

<ol start="33">
<li>And, again, as to why there are eleven,&ndash;the Trishṭubh consists of eleven syllables, and Indra is of trishṭubh nature, Indra is the self (soul) of the sacrifice, Indra is the deity <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>: he thus finally establishes the sacrifice in him who is the self, the deity of the sacrifice.</li>

<h2 id="36">36</h2>
<ol start="36">
<li>And, again, as to why he prepares these oblations.

<h2 id="37">37</h2>
<ol start="37">
<li>Now the same as that Orderer is yonder sun; and that which was the farthest gone of the regions is that in which that (sun) shines firmly established.</li>

<li>And the same as that Orderer is this cake to the Orderer on twelve potsherds.

<li>As to this they say, &lsquo;He should not offer these oblations, lest he should do what is excessive.&rsquo; Let him nevertheless offer them; for these oblations are offered for (the fulfilment) of (special) wishes, and in wishes there is nothing excessive. And whatever oblation is offered after the cake of the animal-offering that is placed inside the victim itself as its sacrificial sap. He offers both kinds (of oblations), those of the Soma-sacrifice and those of the Agni(-cayana), to wit, first those of the Soma-sacrifice, and then those of the fire-altar: the significance of this has been explained. The cake-offering of the animal sacrifice is (performed) in a loud voice, and these (five oblations) in a low voice, for they are an ishṭi <sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>.

<p>267:4 Mahīdhara (and apparently Sāyaṇa) seems to supply &lsquo;yajamānam&rsquo; to &rsquo;etam,&rsquo; and construe thus: &lsquo;Unto thee, O heavenly sent, I commit this (Sacrificer), which treasure Jātavedas shall bring thither.&rsquo;&#160;<a href="#fnref:37" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>267:5 &lsquo;O gods, honour ye him (the Sacrificer)!&rsquo; Mahīdhara; but perhaps the R̥shis are addressed in this second line.

<p>268:2 The meaning of the verse is, however, far from certain. The above is Mahīdhara&rsquo;s interpretation, except that he takes &lsquo;yāḥ&rsquo; to mean &lsquo;and what (other) streams there are.&rsquo; It might, however, also mean&ndash;&lsquo;What streams of honey and ghee of ours are never-failing anywhere&ndash;Agni Vaiśvakarmaṇa shall deposit them in heaven with the gods!&rsquo;&ndash;in which case due reward for sacrifice would be prayed for.&#160;<a href="#fnref:40" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>271:5 Though there is nothing in the text to show where this quotation  begins, it would seem, from Kātyāyana&rsquo;s rules, that it runs from the beginning of paragraph 58,&ndash;XVIII, 6, 33. In case of inability (to perform a second) cityā, at a repeated Soma-sacrifice, (he may lay down) one or other kind of the Svayamātr̥ṇṇās, Viśvajyotishas, or R̥tavyās; 34. The Punaściti; 35.
