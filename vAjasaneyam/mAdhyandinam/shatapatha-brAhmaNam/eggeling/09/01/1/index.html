<li>He offers wild sesamum seeds. He (Agni) grows when he is being built up: he grows for (the consumption) of every kind of food.

<li>And as to why he performs the Śatarudriya offering. When Prajāpati had become disjointed, the deities departed from him. Only one god did not leave him, to wit, Manyu (wrath): extended he remained within. He (Prajāpati) cried, and the tears of him that fell down settled on Manyu. He became the hundred-headed, thousand-eyed, hundred-quivered Rudra. And the other drops that fell down, spread over these worlds in countless numbers, by thousands; and inasmuch as they originated from crying (rud), they were called Rudras (roarers). That hundred-headed, thousand-eyed, hundred-quivered Rudra, with his bow strung, and his arrow fitted to the string, was inspiring fear, being in quest of food. The gods were afraid of him.</li>

<p>168:1 For the mahad uktham, or Great Litany, recited on the Mahāvrata day, see p. 110, note 3. According to Sāyaṇa, however, this does not refer to the Mahad uktham, or Great Litany, itself, but to its Stotra, the Mahāvrata-sāman (cf. note on X, 1, 1, 5), by the chanting of which it is preceded, and which, like the Great Litany itself, is represented as being composed of the different parts of Agni-Prajāpati&rsquo;s bird-shaped body. Now, that part of the chant which corresponds to the god&rsquo;s trunk (ātman) is the only part of this Stotra which is chanted in the Pañcaviṁśastoma, or twenty-five-versed hymn-form, which, indeed, is the characteristic Stoma of the Mahāvrata day, all other Stotras of that rite being chanted in that form. It is, however, doubtful to me whether it is not rather the opening part of the Great Litany itself representing the trunk that is here referred to, and which, indeed, consists of twenty-five verses; cf. F. Max Müller, Upanishads, I, p. 183. Besides, it has always to be borne in mind that the particular arrangement of the Great Litany which the authors of the Brāhmaṇa had before them, may have differed in some respects from those known to us.&#160;<a href="#fnref:26" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
