<ol start="2">
<li>With water he sprinkles him <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>,&ndash;water is a means of appeasing (soothing): he thus appeases him thereby.

<h2 id="03">03</h2>

<li>And, again, as to why he sprinkles him,&ndash;that Agni (the fire-altar), doubtless, is these worlds: by water he thus encompasses these worlds, by the ocean, indeed, he encompasses them.

</ol>
<h2 id="04">04</h2>
<ol start="4">
<li>For safety from injury it is the Agnīdh who sprinkles, for the Agnīdh is the same as Agni, and no one injures his own self.

With &lsquo;In the rock is thy hunger,&rsquo; he (after watering the altar) sets down (the pitcher on the stone): he thus lays hunger into the stone, whence the stone is not fit for eating. But hard also is the stone, and hard is hunger: he thus puts the hard along with the hard. With, &lsquo;In me thy food!&rsquo; he takes up (the pitcher): he thereby takes up the food into his own self. Thus (he does) a second and a third time.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="06">06</h2>
<ol start="6">
<li>Having (finally) set down the pitcher, he perambulates thrice (the altar); for when (in sprinkling) he walks all round it, he, as it were, makes light of him (Agni-Rudra). He now makes amends to him, for (his own) safety.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="07">07</h2>
<ol start="7">
<li>And, again, as to why he perambulates it,&ndash;he then (in sprinkling the altar) goes after him <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> (Agni-Rudra): thereupon he now recovers his own self unto life, and so does he by that self of his obtain all vital power.</li>

<li>Having thereupon put that stone into the water-pitcher, they throw it in that (south-western) direction, for that is Nirr̥ti&rsquo;s region: he thus consigns pain <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> to Nirr̥ti&rsquo;s region.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="10">10</h2>

<li>For at that time, the gods, having appeased him by the Śatarudriya and the water, thereby drove out his pain, his evil; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer) now, after appeasing him by the Śatarudriya and the water, cast away his pain, his evil.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="11">11</h2>
<ol start="11">
<li>Outside the fire-altar he throws it; for this fire-altar indeed is the same as these (three) worlds: he thus puts pain outside these worlds;&ndash;outside the sacrificial ground (vedi); for the Vedi is this (earth): he thus puts pain outside this earth.</li>

<h2 id="12">12</h2>

<li>Whilst standing at the right thigh of the Vedi, with his face to the east, he throws it southwards, with, &lsquo;Let thy pain enter him whom we hate!&rsquo; and thus its pain enters whomsoever he hates. He may say, &lsquo;Let thy pain enter so-and-so!&rsquo; naming him whom he hates, and then he has no longer any hold upon him; but let him take no notice of this, for indicated of himself is he whom he who knows this hates. If it <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> should remain unbroken, let him bid (the Pratiprasthātr̥) to break it; for only when it is broken, the pain enters him whom he hates.

<h2 id="14">14</h2>
<ol start="14">
<li>And some say, &lsquo;Let him make them his own whilst sitting, for sitting one milks the cow.&rsquo; But let him rather make them his own standing; for that fire-altar is these worlds, and these worlds are, as it were, standing. And, moreover, one is stronger whilst standing.</li>

<h2 id="17">17</h2>
<ol start="17">
<li>And as to why he makes the bricks his own milch cows,&ndash;this fire-altar is speech, for with speech it is built up; and when he says, &lsquo;One, and ten, . . . and a hundred thousand millions, and a billion,&rsquo;&ndash;&lsquo;one&rsquo; is speech, and a hundred thousand millions is speech, and a billion is speech: it is Speech herself that the gods thereby made their own milch cow; and in like manner does the Sacrificer thereby make Speech herself his own milch cow.

They called them by the name &rsquo;the widely-shining,&rsquo; and they turned unto them. Hence, each time he has laid down ten bricks, he addresses them with the &lsquo;space-filling <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> (verse)&rsquo;: he thereby makes them widely-shining (virāj), for the Virāj (metre) consists of ten syllables:&ndash;&lsquo;wish-milking, never-failing,&rsquo;&ndash;he thereby makes them wish-milking and never-failing.</li>

The verse, as figured for chanting, is given, Sāma-v. Calc. ed. vol. v, p. 60 1. On the present occasion, according to Lāṭy. Śr. I, 5, 11, a different text, viz. Sāma-v. II, 8, 14 (R̥g-veda IX, 66, 19, agna āyūṁshi payase), is to be sung to this tune.&#160;<a href="#fnref:13" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>180:2 Viz. on the place where the right wing joins the body of the altar. According to other authorities, the Śyaita hymn-tune is likewise to be sung near the left arm-pit (or, according to Sāṇḍilya, at the place where the Adhvaryu mounts the altar). For other variations, see Weber, Ind. Stud. XIII, p. 276. I do not think that the ritual of the White Yajus, in omitting the left arm-pit, shows any gap or inconsistency, since the right arm-pit is marked out, not for any bodily parallelism, but for the simple reason that it is supposed to indicate the position of the heart. Whilst all the other places on which hymns are sung are essential parts of the bird Agni, the arm-pit is not an essential part, but is merely indicative of the central organ of the body. Lāṭy. I, 5, 11 seqq. supplies the following directions, apparently implying a somewhat different order of procedure from that followed in our text: He passes along the south, and whilst standing (east of the altar) with his face towards the west, he sings the Gāyatra at the head. Returning, he sings the Rathantara at the right wing. Going round behind, he sings the Br̥hat at the left wing. Going back, and standing behind the tail, with his face towards the east, he sings the Yajñāyajñiya. The Vāmadevya he sings at the right, and the Prajāpati-hr̥daya at the left, arm-pit. Then follow different views held by different teachers.&ndash;With this ceremony, by which homage is paid to the different parts of Agni-Prajāpati&rsquo;s body, compare the similar, but more elaborate, ceremony of the Parimādaḥ at the Mahāvrata, X, 1, 2, 9 with note.&#160;<a href="#fnref:17" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>181:2 According to Lāṭy. I, 5, 1 seq., it is the Prastotr̥ who sings these sāmans. A similar conflict of competence in this respect is referred to not only in regard to detached sāmans (cf. Kāty. IV, 9, 6-9), but even in regard to such solemn performances as the chanting of the Mahāvrata-sāman (cf. note on X, 1, 1, 5).&#160;<a href="#fnref:19" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
