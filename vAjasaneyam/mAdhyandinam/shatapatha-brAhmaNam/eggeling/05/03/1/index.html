<p>him that he is thereby consecrated (or quickened), and him he makes his own faithful (follower). The sacrificial fee for this (jewel-offering) consists in gold; for Agni&rsquo;s is that sacrifice, and gold is Agni&rsquo;s seed: therefore the sacrificial fee consists in gold.</p>

And he, the Purohita, assuredly is one of his (the king&rsquo;s) jewels: it is for him that he is thereby consecrated, and him he makes his own faithful follower.

And she, the Queen, assuredly is one of his (the king&rsquo;s) jewels: it is for her that he is thereby consecrated, and he makes her his own faithful (wife). The sacrificial fee, on her part, is a milch cow; for this (earth) is, as it were, a milch cow: she yields to men all their desires; and the milch cow is a mother, and this (earth) is, as it were, a mother: she bears (or sustains) men. Hence the fee is a milch cow.</li>

And he, the Sūta, assuredly is one of his (the king&rsquo;s) jewels: it is for him that he is thereby consecrated; and him he makes his own faithful (follower).

The sacrificial fee for this (jewel) is a spotted bullock, for in such a spotted bullock there is abundance of colours; and the Maruts are the clans (or peasants), and the clan means abundance; therefore the sacrificial fee is a spotted bullock.</p>
<h2 id="07">07</h2>
<ol start="7">
<li>And on the following day he goes to the house of the Chamberlain (kshattr̥), and prepares a cake on either twelve, or eight, potsherds for Savitr̥; for Savitr̥ is the impeller (prasavitr̥) of the gods, and the chamberlain is an impeller: hence it is for Savitr̥. And he, the chamberlain, assuredly is one of his (the king&rsquo;s) jewels: it is for him that he thereby is consecrated, and him he makes his own faithful (follower). The sacrificial fee for this (jewel) is a reddish-white draught-bullock; for Savitr̥ is he that burns yonder, and he (the sun) indeed moves along; and the draught-bullock also moves along, when yoked.

The sacrificial fee for this (jewel) is a pair of twin bullocks, for such twin bullocks are of the same womb.

And he, the courier, assuredly is one of his (the king&rsquo;s) jewels: it is for him that he is thereby consecrated, and him he makes his own faithful follower.

The fee for this (oblation) consists of a black, decrepit, diseased cow; for such a one also is possessed with Nirr̥ti.

<p>58:2 Ratna, jewel, precious thing; whence the eleven offerings described in this section are called ratna-havis, or ratnināṁ havīṁshi; the recipients of these sacrificial honours, on the part of the newly-consecrated king, being called ratninaḥ, &lsquo;possessed of the Jewel (offering).&rsquo;&ndash;In the ritual of the Black Yajus (Taitt. S. I, 8, 9; Taitt. Br. I, 1, 3) the order of the Ratninaḥ, at whose houses these oblations are performed on successive days, is as follows&ndash;1. Brahman priest (a pap to Br̥haspati); 2. Rājanya (a cake of eleven kapālas to Indra); 3. Consecrated Queen (pap to  Aditi); 4. The king&rsquo;s favourite wife (pap to Bhaga); 5. A discarded wife (pap to Nirr̥ti); 6.

Bhāgadugha (collector of taxes, Sāy.&ndash;pap to Pūshan); 12.

<p>60:1 The exact function of this officer is not clearly defined. Though the term is also used of an ordinary village headman (Patel, Adhikārin, Adigar), this could hardly apply here. Sāyaṇa, on one passage, indeed explains the term by &lsquo;Grāmaṁ nayati,&rsquo; but elsewhere he explains it by &lsquo;Grāmāṇāṁ netā;&rsquo; and some such meaning it may perhaps have here,&ndash;the head of communal administration, either for a district (like one of Manu&rsquo;s lords of a hundred, or a  thousand villages), or for the whole country. If, however, the headman of a single village be intended (as the coupling of the office with the Maruts might lead one to suppose), he would probably be a hereditary territorial proprietor residing near the place where the inauguration ceremony takes place. Cf. V, 4, 4, 18; and Zimmer. Altindisches Leben, p. 171.&#160;<a href="#fnref:4" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>62:1 Savyashṭḥri (otherwise savyeshṭḥr̥, savyeshṭḥa;&ndash;savyastha, Kāṇva rec.) is explained by the commentaries as a synonym of sārathi, charioteer (with which it is compounded in savyeshṭḥasārathī, Taitt. Br. I, 7, 9, 1, where Sāyaṇa makes them the two charioteers standing on the left and right side of the warrior), but it seems more probable that the former terms refer to the warrior (παραβάτης) himself (as savyashṭḥā, Atharva-veda VIII, 8, 23, undoubtedly does), who stands on the left side of the driver (sārathi, ἡνίοχος); the Change of meaning being perhaps due to caste scruples about so close an association between the Kshatriya warrior and his Śūdra servant, as is implied in this and other passages. (Cf. V, 3, 2, 2 with note.)&ndash;On Taitt. S. I, 8, 9, Sāyaṇa explains saṁgrahītr̥ as the treasurer (dhanasaṁgrahakartā kośādhyakshaḥ), but on I, 8, 16 optionally as treasurer or charioteer; while the Sūta is I, 8, 9 identified by him with the charioteer (sārathi). It is more probable, however, that at the time of the Brāhmaṇa the Sūta occupied much the same position as that assigned to him in the epics, viz. that of court-bard and chronicler. The connection of the saṁgrahītr̥ with the Aśvins can also scarcely be said to favour the interpretation of the term proposed by Sāyaṇa (who, moreover, is himself compelled, on Taitt. S. I, 8, 15; Taitt. Br. I, 7, 10, 6, to take it in the sense of charioteer).&#160;<a href="#fnref:5" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>63:1 The meaning &rsquo;tax-gatherer, collector of tithes (or rather, of the sixth part of produce)&rsquo; assigned to the term by Sāyaṇa, both here, and on Taitt. S. I, 8, 9, might seem the more natural one, considering the etymology of the term. See, however, the explanation given of it in our Brāhmaṇa I, 1, 2, 17:&ndash;&lsquo;Pūshan is bhāgadugha (distributor of portions) to the gods, who places with his hands the food before them.&rsquo; This clearly is Homer&rsquo;s δαιτρός, Od.
