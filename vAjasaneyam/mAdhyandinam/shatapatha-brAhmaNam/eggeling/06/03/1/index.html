<p>now soil means cattle: thus, &lsquo;from the earth&rsquo;s lap bring thou Agni, favourable to cattle, as Agni (did)!&rsquo;&ndash;&lsquo;by the Trishṭubh metre, Aṅgiras-like!&rsquo; he thereby takes it with the Trishṭubh metre and thus lays into it the Trishṭubh metre.</p>

<li>With three (formulas) he takes it up,&ndash;threefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus takes it.

<li>He takes it up with four (formulas), for all speech consists of four syllables: &lsquo;vāk&rsquo; (speech) is one syllable, and &lsquo;aksharam&rsquo; (syllable) consists of three syllables. Now that monosyllable &lsquo;vāk&rsquo; is the same as this last one, the Anushṭubh; and that trisyllable &lsquo;aksharam&rsquo; is the same as those former formulas: he thus digs up Agni by the whole speech, and equips it with the whole speech,&ndash;hence with four (formulas).</li>

<li>And, again, why with four (formulas);&ndash;there are four quarters: he thus lays speech into the four quarters, whence speech speaks in the four quarters.

<p>201:1 Mahīdhara says, Agni is called &lsquo;purīshya,&rsquo; because loose soil (purīsha) is put in the fire-pan (ukhā), on which the fire is then placed. It also doubtless refers to the loose soil which is spread over the different layers of the altar, thus serving as mortar to the bricks. In this epithet of Agni, &lsquo;purīsha&rsquo; seems, however, to be taken in yet another, more subtle sense, the author apparently connecting with it its etymological meaning of &rsquo;that which fills, fillings, Germ. Füllung, Füllsel;&rsquo; whilst the reference to cattle might also seem to point to the later ordinary meaning, &lsquo;faeces, manure.&rsquo; Mahīdhara, on the force of the symbolical identification &lsquo;paśavo vai purīsham,&rsquo; seems straightway to take &lsquo;purīsha&rsquo; as a synonym of &lsquo;paśu,&rsquo; when he says,&ndash;purīshebhyaḥ paśubhyo hitaḥ purīshyaḥ. Sāyaṇa&rsquo;s comment here is corrupt,&ndash;paśavo vai purīshaṁ pūraṇāmūhi(?) kāryaṁ paśavaḥ pūrayanti.&#160;<a href="#fnref:22" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
