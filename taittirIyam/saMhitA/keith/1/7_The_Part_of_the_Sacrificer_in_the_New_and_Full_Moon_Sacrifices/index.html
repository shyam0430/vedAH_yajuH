<p>&lsquo;By I sacrifice to the divine strew, may I be possessed of children&rsquo;, he says; by the strew Prajapati created offspring, verily he creates offspring. &lsquo;By sacrifice to the god Naraśansa, may I be possessed of cattle&rsquo;, he says; by Naraśansa Prajapati created cattle; verily he creates cattle. &lsquo;By sacrifice to the god, Agni Svistakrt, may I attain security through the sacrifice, having long life&rsquo;, he says; verily he confers life on himself, and finds support through the sacrifice. With the victory of the new and full moon sacrifices [1] the gods conquered, and by means of the new and full moon sacrifices they drove away the Asuras. &lsquo;May I be victorious through the victory of Agni&rsquo;, he says; verily through the victory of the deities in the new and full moon sacrifices the sacrificer is victorious, and by means of the new and full moon offerings drives away his enemies. With two verses containing the word &lsquo;strength&rsquo;, he accompanies the separation (of the ladles) strength is food verily he wins food; (he uses) two, for support. He who sacrifices knowing the two milkings of the sacrifice milks thus</p>
<p>the sacrifice on both sides [2], in front and behind; this is one milking of the sacrifice, another is in the Ida. When the Hotr utters the name of the sacrificer, then he should say, &lsquo;Hither these blessings have come, fain for milking&rsquo;; verily he milks the deities which he praises together; verily he milks<br>
the sacrifice on both sides, in front and behind. &lsquo;With the red steed may Agni convey thee to the god&rsquo;, he says; these are the steeds of the gods [3], the straw is the sacrificer; in that he casts forward the straw with them, he makes the sacrificers to go by the steeds of the gods to the world of heaven. &lsquo;I unyoke thy head ropes, thy reins&rsquo;, he says; that is the unyoking of Agni; verily thereby he unyokes him. &lsquo;By sacrifice to the god Visnu, by the sacrifice may I attain health and wealth and security&rsquo;, he says; Visnu is the sacrifice; verily the sacrifice finds support at the end. &lsquo;By sacrifice to the god Soma, possessing good seed [4], may I impregnate seed&rsquo;, he says; Soma is the impregnator of seed; verily he confers seed upon himself. &lsquo;By sacrifice to the god Tvastr, may I prosper the form of cattle&rsquo;; Tvastr is the form-maker of the pairings of cattle, and thereby he confers upon himself the form of cattle. &lsquo;The wives of the gods, Agni, the lord of the house, are the pair of the sacrifice; by sacrifice to these deities may I be propagated with a pair.&rsquo; &lsquo;Thou art the bundle, thou art gain, may I gain&rsquo;, he says; by the bundle (vedena) the gods won (avindanta) the desirable wealth of the Asuras, and that is why the bundle has its name. Whatever of his foe&rsquo;s he may covet, the name of that he should utter; verily he wing it all from him. &lsquo;May the bundle bestow increase of wealth, rich in ghee, rich in houses, a thousandfold, strong&rsquo;, he says; he obtains a thousand cattle. In his offspring a strong one is born who knows thus.</p>
<h2 id="05">05</h2>
<p>Through the emptying of the Dhruva the sacrifice is emptied, through the sacrifice the sacrificer, through the sacrificer offspring. Through the swelling of the Dhruva, the sacrifice is made to swell, through the sacrifice the sacrificer, through the sacrificer offspring. &lsquo;Let the Dhruva swell with ghee&rsquo;, he says; verily he makes the Dhruva to swell; through its swelling the sacrifice is made to swell, through the sacrifice the sacri ficer, throuoh the sacrificer offspring. &lsquo;Prajapati&rsquo;s is the world called Vibhan. In it I place thee along with the sacrificer&rsquo;, he says [1]; the world of Prajapati, named Vibhan, is this (world); verily he places it in it along with the sacrificer. In that he sacrifices he is as it were emptied; in that he eats the sacrificer&rsquo;s portion, he fills himself. The sacrifice is the size of the sacrificer&rsquo;s portion, the sacrificer is the sacrifice; in that he eats the sacrificer&rsquo;s portion, he places the sacrifice in the sacrifice. There is good grass and good water where the strew and the waters are [2]; the Vedi is the abode of the sacrificer; in that he places the full bowl within the Vedi, he establishes good grass and good water in his own abode. &lsquo;Thou art real, be real for me&rsquo;, he says; the sacrifice is the waters, ambrosia is the water; verily he bestows upon himself the sacrifice and the waters. All creatures attend him who is performing the vow. &lsquo;In the eastern quarter may the gods, the priests, make (me) bright&rsquo;, he says; this is the concluding bath of the new and full moon sacrifices [3]. He goes to the bath along with the creatures which attend him as he performs the vow. Headed by Visnu the gods won these worlds by the metres so as to be irrecoverable; in that he takes the steps of Visnu the sacrificer becoming Visnu wins these worlds by the metres so as to be irrecoverable. &lsquo;Thou art the step of Visnu, smiting imprecations&rsquo;, he says; the earth is the Gayatri, the atmosphere is connected with the Tristubh, the sky is the Jagati, the quarters are connected with the Anustubh; verily by the metres he wins these worlds in order.</p>
<h2 id="06">06</h2>
<p>&lsquo;We have come to the heaven: to the heaven we have come&rsquo;, he says; verily he goes to the world of heaven. &lsquo;May I not be cut off from seeing thee; what heat is thine, to that of thee may I not be brought low&rsquo;, he says; that is according to the text. &lsquo;Thou art good, the best of rays; thou art life bestowing, bestow life upon me&rsquo;, he says; verily he invokes this blessing. He falls away from this world, who [1] takes the steps of Visnu, for from the world of heaven the steps of Visnu are taken. The theologians say, &lsquo;He indeed would take the steps of Visnu who after acquiring these worlds of his foe should descend again to this world.&rsquo; This is his return descent to this world, in that he says,&lsquo;Here do I exclude my enemy N. N. from these quarters, from this sky&rsquo;; verily having acquired these worlds of his foe he descends again to this world. &lsquo;I have been united [2] with the light&rsquo;, he</p>
<p>says; verily he rests on this world. &lsquo;I turn the turning of Indra&rsquo;, he says; Indra is yonder sun; verily he turns his turning. He turns to the right; verily he revolves round his own strength; therefore the right side of a man is the stronger; verily also he turns the turning of the sun. &lsquo;May I be united with offspring, offspring with me&rsquo;, he says; verily [3] he invokes this blessing. &lsquo;Kindled, O Agni, shine<br>
for me; kindling thee, O Agni, may I shine&rsquo;, he says; that is according to the text. &lsquo;Be rich the sacrifice; may I be rich&rsquo;, he says; verily he invokes this blessing. Within the Garhapatya much variegated work is performed; with two verses to Agni, the purifier, he pays reverence to the Garhapatya; verily he purifies the fire, he purifies himself; (he uses) two for support. &lsquo;O Agni, lord of the house&rsquo;, he says [4]; that is according to the text. &lsquo;For a hundred winters&rsquo;, he says; &lsquo;for a hundred winters may I kindle thee&rsquo;, he says in effect. He utters the name of his son; verily he makes him an eater of food. &lsquo;This prayer I utter, bringing light for the race&rsquo;, he should say who has no son born to him, verily is born to him a brilliant and resplendent son. &lsquo;This prayer I utter, bringing light to N. N.&rsquo;, he should say who has a son born [5]; verily he bestows upon him brilliance and splendour. He who having yoked the sacrifice does not let it free becomes without a support. &lsquo;Who yoketh thee? Let him set thee free&rsquo;, he says; Who (ka) is Prajapati; verily by Prajapati he yokes him, by Prajapati he lets him free, for support. The vow if not released is liable to consume (the sacrificer); &lsquo;O Agni, lord of vows, I have performed my vow&rsquo;, he says; verily he releases his vow [6], for atonement, to prevent burning. The sacrifice goes away, and turns not back; to him who sacrifices knowing the restoration of the sacrifice it does turn back; &lsquo;The sacrifice hath become, it hath come into being&rsquo;, he says; this is the restoration of the sacrifice, and thereby he restores it. Excellence has not been obtained by him who having established a fire has no retinue; cattle indeed are the retinue of a Brahman. Having sacrificed, he should step forward to the east and say, &lsquo;Rich in cattle, in sheep, O Agni, in horses is the sacrificer&rsquo;; he wins his retinue, he obtains a thousand cattle, in his offspring a strong one is born.<br>

In the greatness of his manhood, he, O ye men, is Indra.</p>
<h3 id="f-5">f</h3>
<p>Hitherward be thy might with aid, O dread Indra,<br>
What time the armies meet in combat,<br>
And the arrow flieth from the arms of the strong men;<br>
Let not thine [2] anger spread on every side.</p>
<h3 id="g-5">g</h3>
<p>Destroy us not; bring and give to us<br>
That plenteous bounty which thou hast to give to the pious man,<br>
For this new gift, this song we have sung to thee;<br>
Let us speak forth in praise of Indra.</p>
<h3 id="h-4">h</h3>
<p>Bring it to us, let none intercept it;</p>
<p>For we know thee as wealth lord of riches;<br>
That mighty gift of thine, O Indra,<br>
Vouchsafe it us, O lord of the bay steeds [3].</p>
<h3 id="i-1">i</h3>
<p>With our oblation we summon<br>
1ndra, the giver;<br>
Fill both thy hands with bounty;<br>
Give to us from the left and the right.</p>
<h3 id="k-1">k</h3>
<p>The giver, the bolt-bearer, the bull, the overpowering,<br>
The impetuous, the king, slayer of Vrtra, drinker of the Soma,<br>
Seated at this sacrifice on the strew,<br>
Be thou health and wealth to the sacrificer.</p>
<h3 id="l">l</h3>
<p>Indra, the protector, the granter of aid with his aids;<br>
All knowing, be kindly to us;<br>
Let him restrain the enemy, let him make security,<br>
May we be lords of strength [4].</p>
<h3 id="m-1">m</h3>
<p>May we enjoy the favour of him the worshipful,<br>
And also his loving kindness;<br>
May the protector Indra, the granter of aid,<br>
For ever fend far from us the enemy.</p>
<h3 id="n-1">n</h3>
<p>Rich banquets be ours with Indra,<br>
With mighty strength,<br>
Wherewith fed we may be glad.</p>
<h3 id="o-1">o</h3>
<p>To Indra, here sing strength<br>
To place his chariot in the front;<br>
Even in conflict in battle he maketh wide room;<br>
Slayer of foes in the contests<br>
Be thou our comforter;<br>
Let the feeble bowstrings<br>
Of the others break on their bows.</p>
