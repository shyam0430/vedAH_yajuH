7. Nov they quote also (the following verse): 'Or, in times of distress--not as a rule--he may bathe in (water) confined (in tanks), after taking out three lumps (of earth); from a well (let him take three) lumps of clay and three jars of water.' [^4] 


[^4]:  Viṣṇu LXIV, 2. I read the verse as follows: uddhṛtya vāpi trīn piṇḍān kuiyād āpatsu no sadā | niruddhāsu ca mṛtpiṇḍān kūpāt trīn abghaṭāṃstatheti || The Dekhan MSS. read at the end of the second half verse, kūpāṃstrīnavaṭāṃstathā; M. has kupātṝnabapaṭānstathā while C. I. gives kūpāt trīn ghaṭāṃstathā. Nandapaṇḍita on Viṣṇu, loc. cit., seems to have had the latter p. 239 reading, and to have changed it to 'kūpāt to trin ghaṭāṃstathā,' in order to save the metre. The sense remains the same.
