7. The Veda shows the existence of the three debts in the following (passage): 'A Brāhmaṇa is born loaded with three debts; (he owes) the studentship to the sages, sacrifices to the gods, and a son to the manes;' [^2] 


[^2]:  Vasiṣṭha XI, 48. After this Sūtra the MSS. of the text p. 272 insert the following corrupt passage: bandham riṇamokṣam prajāyāś cāyattam piṭṝnāṃ cānukarshaśabdaś ca prajāyāṃ darśayati | anutsannaḥ prajāvān bhavati | yā vad enaṃ prajānugṛhṇīte tāvad akṣayaṃ lokaṃ gayati. The commentary does not notice it, and it seems to me that it needlessly interrupts the context.
