31. A righteous man shall seek to dwell in a village where fuel, water, fodder, sacred fuel, Kuśa grass, and garlands are plentiful, access to which is [^21]  easy, where many rich people dwell, which abounds in industrious people, where Āryans form the majority, and which is not easily entered by robbers.


[^21]:  Gautama IX, 65.
