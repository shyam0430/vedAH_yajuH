13. Let him not pass between the prakīlaka and the beam, at the town gate, [^9] 


[^9]:  Govinda explains prakīlaka by 'a piece of wood fastened at the town gate.' Etymologically it would mean 'a strong bolt.' Possibly the rule may be equivalent to Āpastamba I, II, 31, 23, and mean that a Snātaka is not to creep through the small door which is found in all Indian town gates, and left open after the gates have been shut.
