36. 'A Ṛṣi, a learned man, a king, a bride-groom, a maternal uncle, a father-in-law, and an officiating priest are mentioned in the Smṛti as worthy of the honey-mixture at certain times and occasions.' [^23] 


[^23]:  Vasiṣṭha XI, 1-2. A Ṛṣi is, according to Govinda, a man who knows not only the text of the Mantras, but also their sense. But Baudhāyana, Gṛhya-sūtra I, 11, 4, says that a man who knows, besides the Śākhā and its Aṅgas, the Kalpa also, is called Ṛṣikalpa, i.e. one almost a Ṛṣi. See also Āpastamba I, 2, 5, 3. A learned man (vidvas) is probably a student who has finished not only his vow, but learned the Veda, a so-called vidyāsnātaka, Āpastamba I, 11, 30, 3. Regarding the arghya or madhuparka, the honey-mixture, see Āpastamba II, 4, 8, 7-9.
