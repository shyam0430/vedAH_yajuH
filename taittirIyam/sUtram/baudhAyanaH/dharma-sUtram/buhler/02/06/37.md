37. 'A Ṛṣi, a learned man, and a king must be [^24]  honoured whenever they come, a bridegroom and a priest at the beginning of the religious rites, a maternal uncle and a father-in-law when a year has elapsed since their last visit.'


[^24]:  Gautama V, 27-30. I read kriyārambhe varartvijau. The p. 245 meaning is that a bridegroom is to receive the honey-mixture when he comes to his father-in-law's house for his wedding, and an officiating priest when he comes to perform a sacrifice.
