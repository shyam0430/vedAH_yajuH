3. And bathe after sunset. [^3] 


[^3]:  This and the following six S큰tras are left out in M. and the two copies of the commentary. If they have, nevertheless, been received. into the text, the reason is that similar rules occur in all Dharmas큰tras, and that S큰tra 3 begins with astamite, while astamaye occurs in S큰tra 10. It seems therefore probable that the writer of the MS. from which M. and Govinda's copies are derived, skipped over a line by mistake.
