8. It is declared in the Veda, 'After the Brahmādhāna the sacrificer himself (contains) the sacrificial fires. His respiration (prāṇa, represents) the Gārhapatya fire, the air that goes downwards (apāna, represents) the Anvāhāryapacana (or Dakṣiṇa) fire, the circulation in the body (vyāna, represents) the Āhavanīya fire, the cerebral circulation (udāna) and the abdominal circulation (samāna, represent) the Sabhya and Āvasathya fires. These five fires are abiding in 'the soul. He (therefore) offers (the oblations) in the soul alone.' [^5] 


[^5]:  Regarding the Brahmādhāna, see above, II, 10, 17, 19.
