19. 'Eight (things) do not cause him who is intent on standing (in the day-time), keeping rigid silence, sitting (at night) with crossed legs, bathing three times a day, and (eating) at the fourth, sixth, or eighth meal-time only, to break his vow, (viz.) water, roots, clarified butter, milk, sacrificial food, the wish of a Brāhmaṇa, an order of his teacher, and medicine.' [^10] 


[^10]:  All the MSS. except M. have snāna, 'bathing,' instead of sthāna, 'standing (in the day-time),' though the reading is clearly wrong.
