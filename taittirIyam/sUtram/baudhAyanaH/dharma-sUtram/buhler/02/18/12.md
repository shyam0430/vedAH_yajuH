12. Let him eat food, given without asking, regarding which nothing has been settled before-hand and which has reached him accidentally, so much only as is sufficient to sustain life. [^7] 


[^7]:  According to Govinda this verse gives the opinion of 'some' teachers, not the author's. Asaṃkḷptam, 'regarding which nothing has been settled beforehand,' indicates, according to Govinda, that the ascetic must not even mentally determine what he is going to eat.
