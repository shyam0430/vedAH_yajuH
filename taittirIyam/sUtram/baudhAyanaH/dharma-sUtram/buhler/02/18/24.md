24. 'Thus (an ascetic) shall not give up the Veda, (but live), until he is liberated from the body, at the root of the tree.' [^14] 


[^14]:  I have taken vṛkṣamūlikovedasaṃnyāsī to stand for vṛkṣamūliko avedasaṃnyasī. For the vedasaṃnyāsa, 'giving up the Veda,' is not permitted to an ascetic; see e.g. Vasiṣṭha X, 4. But even without the negative particle vedasaṃnyāsī may convey a sense not opposed to the general teaching of the Smṛtis. For it may be taken to mean 'abandoning (the recitation of other portions of) the Veda.'
