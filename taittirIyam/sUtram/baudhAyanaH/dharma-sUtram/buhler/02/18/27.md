27. Let him cleanse the vessel of Brahman with the seven Vyāhṛtis. [^15] 


[^15]:  Govinda is uncertain if the term brahmabhājana, 'the vessel of Brahman,' refers to the alms-bowl or to the body of the ascetic. Probably both are meant, and the Sūtra is intended to prescribe the frequent recitation of the Vyāhṛtis in addition to the syllable Om.
