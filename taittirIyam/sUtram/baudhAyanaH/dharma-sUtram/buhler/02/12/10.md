10. After (dinner) he shall drink water, (reciting the text), 'Thou art 'a covering for ambrosia,' and stroke (the region of) the heart, (saying), 'Thou art the bond that connects the vital airs; (thou art) [^6]  Rudra and Death; enter me; mayest thou grow through this food.'


[^6]:  The first text is found Taittirīya Āraṇyaka X, 35, and the second ibid. X, 37. I translate the first according to Govinda.
