10. 'They shall eat every fourth meal-time a little food, bathe at the time of the three libations (morning, noon, and evening), passing (the day) standing and (the night) sitting. After the lapse of three years they throw off their guilt.' [^6] 


[^6]:  Āpastamba I, 9, 25, 10. All the MSS. read in the last pāda 'tribhir varṣais tad apahanti pāpam.' The correct reading is that given by Āpastamba loc. cit., 'tribhir varṣair apa pāpaṃ nudante.'
