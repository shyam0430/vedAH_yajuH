36. The penance for eating impure substances is to fast until the entrails are empty. That is attained in seven (days and) nights. [^24] 


[^24]:  Āpastamba I, 9, 27, 3-4; Vasiṣṭha XXIII, 30. I follow here the Gujarāt and Dekhan MSS., which read amedhyaprāśane prāyaścittir naiṣpurīṣyaṃ tat saptarātreṇāvāpyate. M. and the two MSS. of the commentary give amedhyaprāśane prāyaścittam and leave the remainder out. The commentary states that the penance intended is the Taptakṛcchra, described in the next Sutra. The parallel passages of Āpastamba and others leave no doubt that the northern MSS. in this case have preserved the older form of the text.
