11. 'A Brāhmaṇa removes the sin which he committed by serving the black race during one day and one night, if he bathes during three years at every fourth meal-time.' [^7] 


[^7]:  Āpastamba I, 9, 27, 11. Govinda explains the Sūtra as referring to cohabitation with a female of the 'black race.' By the latter term he understands a Cāṇḍālī, adding that others believe p. 219 a Śūdra female to be intended. It is, however, more probable that Baudhāyana took the verse to forbid twice-born men to serve Śūdras.
