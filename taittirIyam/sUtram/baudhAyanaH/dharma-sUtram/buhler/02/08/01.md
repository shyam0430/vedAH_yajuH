1. Now, after washing his hands, he shall take his waterpot and a clod of earth, go to a (sacred) bathing-place and thrice clean his feet (with earth and water) and thrice his body. [^1] 


[^1]:  8. Viṣṇu LXIV, 18. This Adhyāya contains the rules for bathing, and the subject is introduced, as Govinda observes, because in the preceding chapter II, 4, 7, 2, it has been said that an impure person must bathe before he performs the twilight devotions. Govinda also states that the word ca, 'and,' which stands after mṛtpiṇḍam, 'a clod,' indicates that gomaya, 'cowdung,' must also be employed.
