33. There are innumerable (passages in the Veda) which refer to the debts (to be paid by a Brāhmaṇa), such as, 'May I obtain, O Agni, immortality [^18]  through offspring;' 'A Brāhmaṇa on being born, (owes) a son to his ancestors,' &c.


[^18]:  -34. The commentary omits these two Sūtras, which, however, seem necessary for the completion of the discussion. The p. 262 second occurs also Āpastamba II, 9, 24, 8. Though Baudhāyana does not express himself as clearly as Āpastamba, he disapproves, as it would seem, like the latter, of the opinion of those who gave an undue preference to asceticism at the expense of married life, the order of the householders.
