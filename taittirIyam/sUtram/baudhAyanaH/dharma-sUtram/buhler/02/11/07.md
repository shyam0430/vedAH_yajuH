7. 'The private recitation of the Veda is, indeed, the sacrifice to Brahman. At that sacrifice to Brahman speech, forsooth, (takes the place of) the Juhū, the internal organ (that of) the Upabhṛt, the eye (that of) the Dhruvā, the understanding (that of) the Sruva, truth (that of) the final bath, heaven (is) the conclusion of the sacrifice. He who, knowing this, daily recites the Veda to himself, gains as much heavenly bliss as, and more than, he who gives away this whole earth that is filled with wealth, and imperishable (beatitude), and conquers death. Therefore the Veda should be recited in private. Thus speaks the Brāhmaṇa.' [^3] 


[^3]:  Śatapatha-brāhmaṇa XI, 5, 6, z. See also Taitt. Āraṇyaka II, 17. K. reads dhṛtir dhruvā, 'the firm resolve (takes the place of) the Dhruvā,' which is apparently a correction made according to the Āraṇyaka. According to the commentary the text of the last portion of the quotation runs thus, 'yāvantaṃ ha vā imāṃ vittasya purṇāṃ dadat svargaṃ lokaṃ jayati tāvantaṃ lokaṃ jayati bhūyāṃsaṃ cākṣayyaṃ cāpa mṛtyum jayati ya evaṃ vidvān,' &c. M. and K. do not give the whole passage. The published text of the Śatapatha-brāhmaṇa slightly differs from Govinda's version.
