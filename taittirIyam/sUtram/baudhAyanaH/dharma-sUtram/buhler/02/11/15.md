15. A Vaikhānasa (shall live) in the forest, subsisting on roots and fruit, practising austerities and bathing at morn, noon, and eve; he shall kindle a fire according to the Śrāmaṇaka (rule); he shall eat wild-growing (vegetables and grain) only; he shall worship gods, manes, Bhūtas, men, and Ṛṣis; he shall receive hospitably (men of) all (castes) except those (with whom intercourse is) forbidden; he may even use the flesh of animals killed by carnivorous beasts; he shall not step on ploughed (land); and he shall not enter a village; he shall wear his hair in braids, and dress in (garments made of) bark or skins; he shall not eat anything that has been hoarded for more than a year. [^8] 


[^8]:  This passage, which Govinda gives as one Sūtra, agrees word for word with Gautama III, 26-35, except in the beginning, where Gautama omits 'bathing at morn, noon, and eve.' The MSS. all read bhaikṣam, 'begged food,' instead of baiṣkam, 'the flesh of animals slain by carnivorous beasts.' But Govinda's explanation leaves no doubt as to the correctness of the latter reading. The Dekhan and Gujarāt MSS., including K., read agrāmyabhojī || agrāmyabhojī.
