6. Having invited on the day before (the Śrāddha), or just in the morning, virtuous, pure (men), such as Trimadhus, who know the Vedāṅgas and the sacred texts, who are not related by marriage, nor members of the same family, nor connected through the Veda, at least three, (but always) an odd number, the (sacrificer) makes them sit down on prepared seats, covered with Darbha grass, facing the east or the north. [^6] 


[^6]:  Āpastamba II, 7, 14, 5. All the MSS., including those of the commentary, read yonigotramantrasambandhān instead of yonigotramantrāsambandhān. But the explanation of gotrasambandhāḥ by asagotrāḥ shows still a faint trace of the former existence of the reading which I have restored conjecturally and translated. Its correctness is proved by the parallel passage of Āpastamba.
