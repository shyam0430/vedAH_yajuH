10. Now they quote also (the following verse): One whose appointment can have no result, (viz.) a barren woman, one who has borne sons, one who is past child-bearing, one whose children are (all) dead, and one who is unwilling must not be appointed.' [^9] 


[^9]:  Vasiṣṭha XVII, 57-59. M. and the two copies of the commentary read piśācotpannaputrā ca instead of vasā cotpannaputrā ca, 'a barren woman and one who has borne sons.' I follow the Dekhan and Gujarāt MSS., which undoubtedly give the genuine reading. Perhaps the term avaśām, Vasiṣṭha XVII, 57, should be corrected to vaśām.
