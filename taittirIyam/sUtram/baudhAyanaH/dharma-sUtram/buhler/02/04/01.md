1. 'Anybody but a Brāhmaṇa shall suffer corporal punishment for adultery.' [^1] 


[^1]:  4. Āpastamba II, 10, 26, 20; 10, 27, 11. Govinda thinks that non-Brāhmanical offenders should be burned, in accordance with Vasiṣṭha XXI, 2-3. But mutilation may also be intended. Saṃgrahaṇa, 'adultery,' probably includes all those acts mentioned Manu VIII, 354-358.
