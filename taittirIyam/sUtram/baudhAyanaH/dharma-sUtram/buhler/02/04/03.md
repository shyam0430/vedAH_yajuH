3. 'But corporal punishment (shall) not (be inflicted) for (adultery with) the wives of minstrels and with those who appear on the stage. For (the husbands) carry them (to other men), or, lying concealed (at home), permit them to hold culpable intercourse.' [^3] 


[^3]:  Manu VIII, 362. I read conjecturally, 'saṃsarjayanti tā hyetā niguptāś cālayantyapi,' basing my emendations on Manu's text. The MSS. and Govinda have, saṃsarjayanti tā hyetān niguptāṃś cālayanty api, which gives no good sense. Govinda explains cāraṇadārāḥ, 'the wives of minstrels,' by devadāsyaḥ, 'temple-slaves.'
