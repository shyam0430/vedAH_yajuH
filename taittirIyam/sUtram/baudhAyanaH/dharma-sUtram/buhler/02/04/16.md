16. (A Brāhmaṇa) who is unable (to subsist) by teaching, sacrificing for others, or the acceptance of gifts, shall maintain himself by following the duties of Kṣatriyas, because that is the next following (caste). [^14] 


[^14]:  Vasiṣṭha II, 22. The Sūtra 'adhyāpanayājanapratigrahair aśaktaḥ kṣatradharmeṇa jīvet pratyanantaratvāt' occurs in the two copies of the commentary only. The I. O. copy of the commentary has, however, before it the following words: [dharmya] svādhyāyapravacane evety adhikānāṃ [kāraṃ] darśayati pratigṛhītā tādṛk pratigrahītāraṃ gṛdhnuvanti [tāra ṛdhnu°] ṛtvigyajamānā yājinau p. 236[°jane] tadaśaktau kṣatradharmau. M. reads, dharmanasvādhyāyapravacana [ne] ityadhikāraṇ darśayati pratigrahītādṛk pratigrahītāra ṛdhnuvanti ṛtvigyajamāna yājanau tadaśaktau svādhyāyadhyā [°yādhya] panayajñayājanapratigrahair aśaktama [taḥ] kṣatradharmmeṇa gīvet. The Dekhan and Gujarāt MSS. read, dhārmye svādhyāyapravacane ityadhikāraṃ darśayati | pratigrahe dātā pratigrahītā[ra] ṛdhnuvanti | ṛtvigyajamānā yājane | tadaśaktau kṣatradharmeṇa jīvayet, or have corruptions of this passage. I cannot come to any other conclusion than that the passage which precedes the words translated by me are a very ancient interpolation, caused by the embodiment of a portion of an old Bhāṣya with the text, and that all our MSS., however much they may differ, go back to one codex archetypus.
