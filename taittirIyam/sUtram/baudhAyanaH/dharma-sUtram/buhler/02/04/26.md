26. Now they quote also with reference to this (subject the following) verse in the dialogue between the daughters of Uśanas and Vṛṣaparvan: 'Thou, forsooth, art the daughter of one who praises (others), who begs and accepts (gifts); but I am the child of one who is praised, who gives gifts and does not accept them.' [^23] 


[^23]:  The dialogue mentioned is that between Śarmiṣṭhā and p. 238 Devayānī, which occurs Mahābhārata I, 78. The verse quoted is the tenth of that Adhyāya, and agrees with ours, except that sutāham is read for athāham in the beginning of the second half verse.
