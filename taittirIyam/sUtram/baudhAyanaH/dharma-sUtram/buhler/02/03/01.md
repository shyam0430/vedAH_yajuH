1. A Brāhmaṇa who always carries water (in his pot), who always wears the sacred thread, who daily recites the Veda, who avoids the food of Śūdras, who approaches (his wife) in the proper season, and offers sacrifices in accordance with the rules (of the Veda, after death) never falls from Brahman's heaven. [^1]
