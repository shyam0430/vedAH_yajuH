11. But if a legitimate son of the body (aurasa) is born, the (other) sons of equal caste shall obtain one third share (of the estate). [^11] 


[^11]:  I translate according to the reading of K., M., and the two MSS. of the commentary, aurase tūtpanne savarṇās [°ṇas, M., K.] tṛttyāṃśaharāḥ [°yāṃśaṃ haret, K.] The other MSS. omit the last two words of the Sūtra. The sense of the Sūtra seems to be, that subsidiary sons of equal caste obtain a third of the estate when a legitimate son of the body is born to their father; see also Kātyāyana V, Dig. CCXVIII. Govinda gives the following explanation: aurasaḥ savarṇaputrāś ca vakṣyante | aurasaḥ savarṇāyāṃ saṃśkṛtāyāṃ svayam utpāḍitaḥ [Sūtra 14] | tasminnutpanne savarṇās tṛtīyāṃśaharā bhaveyuḥ | sarvaṃ dhanajātaṃ tredhā vibhajya teṣām ekaṃ ṣoḍaśa saṃpādya trīn dvāvekam iti kalpayet || 'The legitimate son and the sons of equal caste will be described (below). He is called a legitimate son who is begotten by the husband himself on a wedded wife of equal caste. When such a one is born, the (other) sons of equal caste shall obtain one third share. Dividing the whole property into three parts, and making one of them sixteen (?), he shall give three, two, one.'--Govinda.
