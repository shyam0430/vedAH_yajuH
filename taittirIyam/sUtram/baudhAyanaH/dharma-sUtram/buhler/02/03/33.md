33. Aupajandhani (declares that) the first among them alone (is entitled to inherit, and a member of his father's family). [^30] 


[^30]:  -34. Aupajandhani is one of the ancient teachers of the White Yajur-veda, mentioned in the lists incorporated in the Śatapatha-brāhmaṇa XIV, 5, 5, 21; 7, 3, 26. The legends of the White Yajur-veda frequently mention king Janaka of Videha, and assert that that philosopher king had frequent and intimate intercourse with Yājñavalkya and other teachers of the Veda which Āditya revealed. It seems to me, therefore, highly probable that Govinda is right in taking the vocative janaka in Sūtra 34 as a proper name, and in asserting that the verse belongs to a conversation between Aupajandhani and Janaka. This explanation, which possibly may be based on an ancient tradition of Baudhāyana's school, is certainly preferable to Haradatta's statement on Āpastamba II, 6, 13, 7, that these verses express the sentiments of a husband who had neglected to watch his wives, and later learned that he would not derive any spiritual benefit from their offspring. In the text of Sūtra 34 I read with the Dekhan MSS. and Āpastamba, loc. cit., īrṣyāmi, instead of ishyāmi, which M. and the commentary give.
