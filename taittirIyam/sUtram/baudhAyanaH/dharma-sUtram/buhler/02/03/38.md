38. (Viz.) the blind, idiots, those immersed in vice, the incurably diseased, and so forth, [^33] 


[^33]:  Colebrooke and MayÅ«kha, loc. cit. 'The expression "and so forth" includes hunchbacks and other (disabled) persons.'--Govinda. Vyasanin, 'immersed in vice,' may also mean 'afflicted by calamities,' and is perhaps intended to be taken both ways.
