44. Women do not possess independence. [^37] 


[^37]:  Vasiṣṭha V, s. All the MSS. of the text read na strīsvātantryaṃ vidyate, while the text given by the two copies of the commentary has na strī svātantryaṃ vindate. Govinda asserts that the Sūtra is intended to forbid the independent action of women with respect to things inherited. The correct view probably is that with this Sūtra the topic of the duties and rights of women begins, and that the rule contains a general maxim.
