30. (He who was begotten by the same parents) through lust (is called) a Pāraśava. Thus (the various kinds of) sons (have been enumerated). [^27] 


[^27]:  Colebrooke V, Dig. CCXCIII. Govinda points out that the Pāraśava is, according to Baudhāyana, the offspring of a Śūdrā concubine, not of a Śūdrā wife. But see also above, I, 9, 17, 4.
