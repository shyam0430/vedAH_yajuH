51. For male (offenders, i.e.) Brāhmaṇas and so forth, a year's chastity (is prescribed). [^42] 


[^42]:  Govinda points out that this rule refers to adultery with women of equal caste, and thinks that the word 'chastity' indicates that Kṛcchra penances are to be performed; Vasiṣṭha XXI, 16, 17; Viṣṇu LIII, 2. But see Gautama XXII, 29.
