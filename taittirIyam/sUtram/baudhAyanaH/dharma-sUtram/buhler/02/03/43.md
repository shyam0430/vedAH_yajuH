43. The daughters shall obtain the ornaments of their mother, (as many as are) presented according to the custom (of the caste), or anything else (that may be given according to custom). [^36] 


[^36]:  Colebrooke V, Dig. CXXX; Vasiṣṭha XVII, 46. 'Sāmpradāyikam (literally "customary") qualifies (the word) ornaments; sāmpradāyikam (means) what is obtained according to custom; what is given to their mother by the maternal grandfather and grandmother, that (is called) sāmpradāyikam. "Or anything else," (viz.) presented according to custom, (e.g.) a bedstead and the p. 231 like, a couch, and an outer garment, and the like. So much and nothing else shall the daughters receive.'--Govinda.
