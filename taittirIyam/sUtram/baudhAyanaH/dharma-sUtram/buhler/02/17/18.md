[^9]:  Anvāhāryapacana is another name of the so-called Dakṣiṇāgni, in which the sacrificial viands are cooked. The cleansing of the butter (utpavana) is performed by taking hold of the ends of blades of Kuśa grass and dipping the bent middle part into the melted butter and then drawing it upwards. A full burnt oblation (pūrṇāhuti) consists of a whole spoonful. As four spoonfuls are to be taken out, it follows that four oblations are to be offered.
