Taking with him the staves, the rope, the [^18]  cloth for straining water, the waterpot, (and) the alms-bowl, he goes where water (is to be obtained), bathes, sips water, (and) washes himself, (reciting the verses called) Surabhimatī, Abliṅgās, Vāruṇīs, Hiraṇyavarṇās, and Pāvamānīs. Entering the water, he performs sixteen suppressions of the breath, (mentally repeating) the Aghamarshaṇa hymn, ascends the bank, wrings out his dress, puts on another pure dress, sips water, takes the cloth for straining, (saying), 'Om, Bhūḥ, Bhuvaḥ, Svaḥ,' and performs the Tarpaṇa (with the following texts), 'Om, Bhūḥ, I satiate,' 'Om, Bhuvaḥ --, Om, Svaḥ --, Om, Mahaḥ --, Om, Ganaḥ --, Om, Tapaḥ --, Om, Satyam --.'
