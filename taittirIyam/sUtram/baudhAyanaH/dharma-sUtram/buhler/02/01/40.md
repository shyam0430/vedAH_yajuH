40. The unmarried elder brother and the married younger brother, the giver (of the maiden) and the performer of the sacrifices become pure by undergoing a Kṛcchra penance of twelve days, the female (who has been wedded to the younger brother) by (fasting during) three days.' [^31] 


[^31]:  The MSS. all read at the end of the verse, tristrirātreṇa or dvistrirātreṇa. The correct reading appears, however, to be strī trirātreṇa; for Govinda says, yayā saha parivettā bhūtas [bhūttasya C. L, bhūtassāstri C. T.] tasyās trirātreṇopavāsena śuddhiḥ, 'the purification of that female with whom he has become a parivettṛ takes place through three days, i.e. through fasting (three days).'
