'Or he may also heap (fuel) on the fire in the night of the new moon, perform the preparatory rites required for the Darvīhoma, and offer two [^26]  oblations of clarified butter (reciting these two sacred texts): "O Lust, I have broken my vow; my vow have I broken, O Lust; to Lust Svāhā;" "O Lust, I have done evil; evil have I done, O Lust; to Lust Svāhā."'


[^26]:  Taitt. Āraṇyaka II, r 8. The Āraṇyaka has, more appropriately, praṇīya, 'having taken out,' before upasamādhāya, 'may heap (fuel) upon.' The Dekhan and Gujarāt MSS. insert the words 'amṛtaṃ p. 216 vā ājyam amṛtam evātman dhatte,' which occur also in the Āraṇyaka, after the Mantra. According to Govinda pariceṣṭā, 'preparatory rites,' refers to the consecration of the clarified butter, and so forth, The special rules regarding the Darvīhomas are given Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra VI, 10, 17 seq.
