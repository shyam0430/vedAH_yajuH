39. 'An elder brother whose younger brother marries first, the younger brother who marries first, the damsel wedded (by the latter), he who gives her away, and fifthly, he who sacrifices for them (at the wedding), all sink to a region of torment.' [^30] 


[^30]:  Vasiṣṭha XX, 7-8. The MSS. read parivittiḥ parivettā yaś caināṃ [naṃ] parivindati. But it is absolutely necessary to adopt either the various reading given Manu III, 172, yayā ca parividyate, or to read yā cainaṃ parivindati.
