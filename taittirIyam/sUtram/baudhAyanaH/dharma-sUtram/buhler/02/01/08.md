8. (For killing) a Kṣatriya (he shall keep the normal vow of continence) during nine years, [^6] 


[^6]:  -10. Vasiṣṭha XX, 31-33. The words 'shall keep the normal vow of continence' have been inserted in accordance with Govinda's explanation, which apparently is based on Gautama XXII, 14. But it is also possible that Baudhāyana, like Viṣṇu (L, 15) and others, may have intended murderers of Kṣatriyas, Vaiśyas, &c., too, to perform the penance prescribed above, Sūtra 4, only for shorter periods.
