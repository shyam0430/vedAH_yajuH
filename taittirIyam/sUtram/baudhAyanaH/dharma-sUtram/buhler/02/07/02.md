2. Going to a (sacred) bathing-place, he shall bathe, in case he is impure; in case he is pure, he may, optionally, omit the bath. (But in either case) he shall wash his feet and hands. Sipping water and sprinkling himself, while he recites the (Rik-verses) containing the word Surabhi, the Abliṅgas, those addressed to Varuṇa, the Hiraṇyavarṇas, the Pāvamānīs, the (sacred syllables called) Vyāhṛtis, and other purificatory (texts), he becomes pure (and fit to perform the twilight devotions). [^1] 


[^1]:  7. 'A sacred bathing-place, i.e. a river or pond outside the village.'--Govinda. The same author adds that the hands must be washed as far as the wrist, that while sipping water the worshipper is to repeat in the evening, Taittirīya Āraṇyaka X, 31, and in the morning X, 32, and that if he bathes, Taittirīya Āraṇyaka X, 1, 12, and other texts must be recited. The Rik containing the word Surabhi is found Taittirīya Saṃhitā I, 5, 11, 4, 7; the three Abliṅgas, Taittirīya Āraṇyaka X, 1, 11; the four verses addressed to Varuṇa, Taittirīya Saṃhitā III, 4, 11, 4, and Taittirīya Āraṇyaka II, 4, 4. By the term Pāvamānīs the Pavamānānuvāka, Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa I, 4, 8, is meant.
