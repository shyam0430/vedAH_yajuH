12. 'In front (feed) the fathers of the (sacrificer), to the left the grandfathers, to the right the great-grandfathers, and at the back those who pare off (portions) from the cakes.' [^8] 


[^8]:  In the beginning of the verse I read with M. and the I. O. copy of the commentary urastaḥ pitaras tasya, and in the end with the Dekhan and Gujarāt MSS. piṇḍatakṣakāḥ. M. reads piṇḍatarkyā, and the copies of the commentary piṇḍodakāḥ. Both these p. 271 readings are clearly corrupt, and so is the var. lect. of the Gṛhya-saṃgraha, quoted in the Petersburg Dictionary, piṇḍatarkukāḥ. Piṇḍatakṣakāḥ, 'the cutters or parers of the cakes,' is appropriate, because the remoter ancestors, who, as Govinda too declares, are meant by the term, obtain the fragments of the funeral cakes.
