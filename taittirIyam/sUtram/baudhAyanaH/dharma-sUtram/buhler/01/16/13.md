[^6]:  -15. The text of the three Sūtras is exceedingly corrupt, and the Telugu copy of the commentary affords no help. It is, however, clear that the passage left out contained something which corresponded to Gautama IV, 22-23, and treated of the possibility of raising persons of a lower caste to a higher one by intermarriages continued for five or seven generations. The reading of K., which perhaps is the best, will show this: 'niṣādena niṣādyād ā pañcamājjātā bhavanti tam upanayet shaṣṭham yājayet saptamo ’vikṛtājīsamaṃjito saptamauñjīsama ity ekeṣāṃ saṃjñā krameṇa nipatanti.'
