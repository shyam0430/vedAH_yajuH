9. Moreover, the great-grandfather, the grand-father, the father, oneself, the uterine brothers, the son by a wife of equal caste, the grandson, (and) the great-grandson--these they call Sapiṇḍas, but not the (great-grandson's) son;--and amongst these a son and a son's son (together with their father are) sharers of an undivided oblation.

[^8]:  Colebrooke, Dāyabhāga XI, 1, 37; V. Digest CCCXCVII. The text on which Colebrooke's two versions are based differs from that of my MSS. and of Govinda by reading avibhaktadāyādān instead of teṣāṃ ca putrapautram [v. l. °pautrakam] avibhaktadāyam. The meaning of the latter clause, which is placed parenthetically before sapiṇḍān ācakṣate, '(these) they call Sapiṇḍas,' seems to be that a father with his son and grandson share the cakes offered at one funeral sacrifice by the fourth descendant. Its object is to show that the group called Sapiṇḍas consists of two such subdivisions, between whom the middlemost forms the connecting link. For the middlemost, the svayam, 'oneself,' of the text, first offers the cakes to his three ancestors and later receives the cakes, together with his first two descendants, from his great-grandson. Govinda gives no help. He merely remarks that the Sūtra contains a paribhāṣā or technical rule of interpretation, and that the words api ca, 'moreover,' indicate that it is an expansion of Sūtra 2.
