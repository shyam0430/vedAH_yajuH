11. If no other (relations) are living, the property (of a deceased male) descends to them (the Sapiṇḍas). [^10] 


[^10]:  Colebrooke, loc. cit. Both the Dāyabhāga and the Digest read satsvangajeshu, 'when there is male issue,' and the Vīramitrodaya, fol. 218, p. 2, l. 7, agrees with them. The MSS. read all satsv anyeshu, which may, however, be taken with Govinda for asatsv anyeshu, because the preceding word ends in e. Govinda explains anyeshu, 'others,' by aurasādishu, 'legitimate sons of the body, and so forth.'
