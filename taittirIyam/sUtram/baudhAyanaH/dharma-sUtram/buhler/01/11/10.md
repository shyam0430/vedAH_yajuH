10. The sharers of divided oblations they call Sakulyas. [^9] 


[^9]:  Colebrooke, loc. cit. According to Jīmūtavāhana the Sakulyas are the three ascendants beyond the great-grandfather and the three descendants beyond the great-grandson. Others, among p. 179 whom Govinda takes his place, explain the word sakulya to mean 'members of one family' in general. Govinda says, sambandhaviśeṣajñāne sati sapiṇḍā ucyante sambandhamātrajñāne sakulyāḥ|| Ataś ca sapiṇḍā api sakulyāḥ|| 'If a particular relationship is known, they are called Sapiṇḍas; and if (the fact) only is known that relationship exists, Sakulyas. Hence the Sapiṇḍas are also Sakulyas.'
