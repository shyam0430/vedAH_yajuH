12. (A student shall discontinue the study of the Veda) during three days in case his father has died. [^10] 


[^10]:  'This (rule) refers to a student who has not returned home. But on one who has returned home it is obligatory to interrupt the Veda-study until he becomes pure. Here he calls the sub-teacher (upādhyāya) "father," because he gives the Veda. For (an interruption of) twelve days' duration is prescribed on (the death of) a real father (by the Sūtra); "on the death of the mother, the father, and the teacher twelve days."'--Govinda.
