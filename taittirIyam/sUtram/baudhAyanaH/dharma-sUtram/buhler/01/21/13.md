13. 'Of two kinds, forsooth, is the virile energy of a famous Brāhmaṇa who is learned in the Vedas, (that which resides) above the navel and the other (that resides) below the' navel. Through that which [^11]  (resides) above the navel, his offspring is produced when he initiates Brāhmaṇas, when he teaches them, when he causes them to offer sacrifices, when he makes them holy. All these are his children. But through that which resides below the navel the children of his body are produced. Therefore they never say to a Śrotriya who is versed in the Vedas, 'Thou art destitute of offspring.'
