2. Now they quote also (the following verses): 'It is declared that a female who has been purchased for money is not a wife. She cannot (assist) at sacrifices offered to the gods or the manes. Kāśyapa has stated that she is a slave.' [^2] 


[^2]:  Vasiṣṭha I, 36-38. Govinda inserts after the words 'Now they quote also,' two Sūtras in prose: 1. 'Ten virtuous sons and daughters (spring) from a Daiva marriage, ten from a Prājāpatya marriage. It is declared in the Veda that the son of a wife wedded according to the Brāhma rite (sanctifies) ten ancestors, ten descendants, and oneself.' 2. 'The power of learning the Veda also p. 208 belongs to such sons.' None of my MSS. of the text has these words, and they are suspicious, because the phrase 'Now they quote also' usually precedes verses only. The Dekhan and Gujarāt MSS., except K., omit these and the next Sūtra too.
