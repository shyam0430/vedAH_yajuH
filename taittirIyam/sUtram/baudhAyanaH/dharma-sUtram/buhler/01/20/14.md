14. For Vaiśyas and Śūdras are not particular about their wives, [^7] 


[^7]:  'Those whose spouse, i.e. wife, is not restrained, i.e. not fixed by rule, are called not particular about their wives. The meaning is that there is oneness (dāreshvaikyam) with respect to wives, that fixed rules regarding them there are none (niyamas teṣāṃ na bhavati).'--Govinda.
