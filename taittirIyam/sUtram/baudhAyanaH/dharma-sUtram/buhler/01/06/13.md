13. Fire, forsooth, takes up water. [^10] 


[^10]:  According to Govinda, a Brāhmaṇa who goes to fetch water at night, which he may want for personal purification, is ordered to restrain his breath, because thereby the air in the body becomes strong, and fire or heat (agni) is produced. Now as at night the sun is stated to enter the fire and to become subject to it, a Brāhmaṇa, who by restraining his breath has produced fire, has secured the presence of the sun, when he goes to fetch water.
