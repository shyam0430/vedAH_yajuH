9. 'If he has received (the new vessel) from a Śūdra, let him recite (the Gāyatrī) one hundred (times). (If he has received it) from a Vaiśya, fifty (repetitions of the Gāyatrī) are prescribed, but (on receiving it) from a Kṣatriya twenty-five, (and on taking it) from a Brāhmaṇa ten.' [^9] 


[^9]:  According to Govinda, either the praṇava, the syllable Om, or the Gāyatrī are the mantras to be recited, and the recitation is a penance to be performed when the vessel is received. The MSS. of the text mark the verse as quotation by adding the word 'iti,' which the commentary omits.
