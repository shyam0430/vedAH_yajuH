8. Taking refuge with Varuṇa, (he shall recite the mantra), 'That (belongs) to thee, Varuṇa; again to me, Om,' (and) meditate on the indestructible. [^8] 


[^8]:  'Taking refuge with Varuṇa, i.e. saying, "I flee for safety to Varuṇa." (The words), "That for thee, Varuṇa, again to me, Om," (are) the mantras (to be recited) on taking (a new vessel). Its meaning is this: "Those fragments which I have thrown into the water shall belong to thee, Varuṇa," (Saying), "Come, thou (who art) a lord of water-vessels, again to me, Om," he shall meditate on another visible pot as indestructible, i.e. at the end of the Vedic (word) "Om," let him meditate, (i.e.) recollect, that not everything will be turned topsy-turvy, (but that some things are) also indestructible, i.e. that that is not destroyed, does not peṛṣ.'--Govinda. The explanation of the last clause of our Sūtra seems to be that, on pronouncing the syllable (akṣara) Om, the reciter is p. 162 to recollect the etymological import of the word akṣara, 'indestructible,' and thus to guard the new vessel against the miṣap which befell the old one.
