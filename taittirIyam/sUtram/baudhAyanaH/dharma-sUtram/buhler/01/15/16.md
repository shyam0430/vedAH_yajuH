16. (When one comes) from the Cātvāla, (it lies between) the Āhavanīya fire and the Utkara. [^12] 


[^12]:  I read with the MSS. of the text 'cātvālād āhavanīyotkarau.' The two copies of the commentary give cātvālah āhavanīyotkarau. Govinda says that the words antareṇa tīrtham must be understood. For the position of the Cātvāla and the Utkara, see Professor Haug's map, where the road of the priests is also marked, though somewhat differently.
