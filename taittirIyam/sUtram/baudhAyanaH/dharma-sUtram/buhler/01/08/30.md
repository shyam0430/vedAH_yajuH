30. That is contrary (to the rule) in (the case of an earthen) vessel. [^15] 


[^15]:  '(The word) amatram, literally "a vessel," denotes here an earthen vessel. The meaning is that such a one, if it is very much defiled, shall only be put down and not be taken back. Any other (earthen vessel) shall be heated.'--Govinda.
