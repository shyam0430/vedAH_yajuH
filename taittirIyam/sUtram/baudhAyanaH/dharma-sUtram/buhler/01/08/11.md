11. Let him perform (the rite of personal) purification, facing the east or the north, (and) seated in a pure place; (let him) place his right arm between his knees and wash both hands up to the wrist and both feet (up to the ankles). [^3] 


[^3]:  Vasiṣṭha III, 26. Govinda points out that the word śaucam, '(rite of) purification,' has here the meaning of ācamanam, 'sipping water.' He thinks that the ca, 'and,' which stands after pādau, 'both feet,' indicates that other portions of the body which have been defiled must be washed also.
