24. 'If (drops) adhere to his teeth, (they must be considered pure) like the teeth, because they are fixed (in the mouth) like the teeth. Let him not sip water on their account in case they fall. If they flow out, he will be pure.' [^11] 


[^11]:  The MSS. read in the last pāda of this verse, teṣāṃ saṃsrāye [ya or va]-ccuciṭiti. I think saṃsrāvaṇācchucir iti is the correct reading.
