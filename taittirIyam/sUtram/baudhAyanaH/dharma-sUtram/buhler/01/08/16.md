16. The part above the thumb (is called the Tīrtha) sacred to the manes, the part at the tips of the fingers that sacred to the gods, the part at the root of the fingers that sacred to the Ṛṣis. [^5] 


[^5]:  Viṣṇu LXII, 3-4. All the MSS. except M. place the Tīrtha sacred to the gods at the root of the fingers, and that sacred to the Ṛṣis at the tips of the fingers; and Govinda has the same erroneous reading.
