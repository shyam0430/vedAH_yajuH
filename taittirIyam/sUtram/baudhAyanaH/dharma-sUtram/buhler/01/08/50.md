50. The cups and vessels (used) at a sacrifice (must be cleaned) according to the injunction (of the Veda). [^29] 


[^29]:  Govinda explains this Sūtra differently. He says: 'The fault of defilement by remnants does not affect sacrificial cups and vessels. This must be understood. If they are defiled by urine and the like, they must be thrown away.' My explanation is based on the parallel passage of Āpastamba I, 5, 17, 13. See also below, I, 6, 13, 11 seq.
