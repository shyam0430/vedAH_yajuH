9. Thus at (all) Iṣṭis, animal sacrifices, and Soma-sacrifices which may be used as spells (against enemies), the priests shall perform (the sacred rites), wearing red turbans and red dresses; (when reciting the hymn seen by) Vṛṣākapi (he shall) wear a dress and a mantle of many colours and so forth. [^6] 


[^6]:  Govinda states that the words iti ka, and so forth,' are intended to include other incantations. The Vṛṣākapi hymn is found Rig-veda X, 86.
