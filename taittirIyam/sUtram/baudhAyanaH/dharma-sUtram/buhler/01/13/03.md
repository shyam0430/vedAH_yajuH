3. The following (Ṛc) declares that, 'To you, O Maruts, the pure ones, pure viands; to you, the pure ones, I offer a pure sacrifice. They who love the pious rites, who are of pure origin, (themselves) pure and purifiers (of others), came duly to the truthful (worshipper).' [^2] 


[^2]:  Rig-veda VII, 56, 12; Taittirīya-brāhmaṇa II, 8, 5, 5. The meaning of the last portion of the verse is somewhat doubtful. Sāyaṇa gives two different explanations and Govinda a third.
