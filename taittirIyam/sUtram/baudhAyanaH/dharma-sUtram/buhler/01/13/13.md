13. Deer-skins like (dresses) made of bark. [^9] 


[^9]:  Govinda says that, as the treatment of valkala, bark-dresses,' has not been prescribed, the meaning of the SÅ«tra can only be, that bark-dresses and black-buck skins are to be treated alike, i.e. that they are to be cleaned with Bel-nut and rice; see above.
