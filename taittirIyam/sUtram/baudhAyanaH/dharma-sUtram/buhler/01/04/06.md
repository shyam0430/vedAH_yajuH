6. 'A long sacrificial session begins he who commences his studentship. That (night) in which, after being initiated, he (first) offers a piece of sacred fuel corresponds to the Prāyaṇīya (Atirātra of a sacrificial session); that night in which (he offers it last), intending to take the final bath, corresponds to the Udayanīya (Atirātra), Those nights which (lie) between (these two terms correspond) just to the nights of his sacrificial session.' [^5] 


[^5]:  MSS. M. and K., as well as the commentary, read dīrghasattram p. 157 ha vā eṣa upaiti, while the MSS. from the Dekhan and Gujarāt, like the printed edition of the Sat. Br., omit the particle 'ha.' Prāyaṇīya means, literally, 'initial,' and udayanīya, 'final.' Each sattra or sacrificial session begins and ends with an Atirātra sacrifice.
