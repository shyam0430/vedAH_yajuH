14. He who has visited the (countries of the) Āraṭṭas, Kāraskaras, Puṇḍras, Sauvīras, Vaṅgas, Kaliṅgas, (or) Prānūnas shall offer a Punastoma or a Sarvapṛṣṭhā (iṣṭi). [^11] 


[^11]:  The Āraṭṭas dwelt in the Pañjāb (Lassen, Ind. Alth. I, p. 973, sec. ed.), and are greatly blamed, Mahābhārata VIII, 44, 36 seq. The Kāraskaras are named in the same chapter of the Mahābhārata as a degraded tribe, but seem to belong to the south of India. The Kaliṅgas are the inhabitants of the eastern coast of India, between Orissa and the mouth of the Kṛṣṇā river. The Puṇḍras, who are mentioned as a degraded tribe in the Aitareya-brāhmaṇa VII, 18, and occur frequently in the Mahābhārata, and the Vaṅgas belong to Bengal (see Lassen, Ind. Alth. I, 669, sec. ed.; Cunningham, Anc. Geog. p. 480). Regarding the Puṇa-stoma, see Gautama XIX, 7 note; and regarding the Sarvapṛṣṭhā iṣṭi, Taittirīya-saṃhitā II, 3, 7, 1-2.
