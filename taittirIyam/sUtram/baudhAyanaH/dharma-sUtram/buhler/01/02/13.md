13. The inhabitants of Avantī, of Aṅga, of Magadha, of Surāṣṭra, of the Dekhan, of Upāvṛt, of Sindh, and the Sauvīrās are of mixed origin. [^10] 


[^10]:  This and the following two Sūtras are intended to show that the customs prevailing in the countries named have no authority and must not be followed. Avantī corresponds to western Mālvā, Aṅga to western Bengal, Magadha to Bihar, and Surāṣṭra to southern Káṭhīāvāḍ. The Sauvīras, who are always associated with the Sindhians, probably dwelt in the south-west of the Pañjāb, near Multān. The Upāvṛts probably are the same as the Upāvṛttas mentioned Mahābhārata VI, 49. But I am unable to deter-mine their seats.
