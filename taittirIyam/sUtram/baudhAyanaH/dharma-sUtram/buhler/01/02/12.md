12. 'In the west the boundary-river, in the east the region where the sun rises,--as far as the black antelopes wander (between these two limits), so far spiritual pre-eminence (is found).' [^9] 


[^9]:  Vasiṣṭha I, 15. There is a great uncertainty in the MSS. about the word following sindhuḥ. I have adopted the reading of p. 148 M., sindhur vidharaṇī, 'the boundary-river,' which occurs also in the parallel passage of Vasiṣṭha. The Dekhan and Gujarāt MSS. read vicaraṇī or vicaraṇā, and the two copies of the commentary visaraṇī. The sense of these various readings appears to be 'the river that vanishes or looses itself,' i.e. the Sarasvatī.
