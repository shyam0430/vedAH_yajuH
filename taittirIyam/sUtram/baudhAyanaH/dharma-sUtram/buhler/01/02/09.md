9. The country of the Āryas (Āryāvarta) lies to the east of the region where (the river Sarasvatī) disappears, to the west of the Black-forest (Kālakavana), to the north of the Pāripātra (mountains), to the south of the Himālaya. The rule of conduct which (prevails) there, is authoritative. [^6] 


[^6]:  Vasiṣṭha I, 8, 10. Many MSS., and among them the Telugu copy of the commentary, read Pāriyātra instead of Pāripātra, which latter I consider to be the correct form of the word.
