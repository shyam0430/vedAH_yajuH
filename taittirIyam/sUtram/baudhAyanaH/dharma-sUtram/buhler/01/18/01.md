1. Let the king protect (his) subjects, receiving as his pay a sixth part (of their incomes or spiritual merit). [^1] 


[^1]:  18. Vasiṣṭha I, 42-44. Learned Brāhmaṇas do not pay taxes, but the king obtains a sixth part of the spiritual merit which they acquire. Hence Baudhāyana uses the general term, 'a sixth share.'
