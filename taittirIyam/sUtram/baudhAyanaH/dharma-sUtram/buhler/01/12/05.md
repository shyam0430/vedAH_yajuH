5. Five five-toed animals may be eaten, (viz.) the porcupine, the iguana, the hare, the hedgehog, the tortoise and the rhinoceros, excepting the rhinoceros, [^4] 


[^4]:  Vasiṣṭha XIV, 39. Another explanation of the word śvāviṭ, 'the porcupine' (see also Gautama XVII, 27), is given in the commentary, which says that it is a wild animal resembling a dog, and belonging to the boar species. Govinda points out that there is a dispute among the learned regarding the rhinoceros (Vasiṣṭha XV, 47), and that the peculiar wording of the Sūtra is intended to indicate that.
