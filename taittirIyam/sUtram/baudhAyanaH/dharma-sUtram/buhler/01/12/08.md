8. (And the following) fishes, (viz.) the Silurus Pelorius (Sahasradaṃṣṭrin), the Cilicima, the Varmi, the Bṛhacchiras, the Maśakari(?), the Cyprinus Rohita, and the Rāji. [^7] 


[^7]:  Vasiṣṭha XIV, 41-42. The names are much corrupted in the MSS., and for Maśakari, which I do not find in the dictionaries, Samaśakari or Samasakari is also read. The Bṛhacchiras is probably the Indian salmon, the Māhsir.
