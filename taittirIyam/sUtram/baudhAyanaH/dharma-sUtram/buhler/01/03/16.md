16. Let him beg, (employing a formula) consisting of seven syllables, with the word bhavat in the beginning, with the word bhikṣā in the middle, and with the (verb expressing) the request at the end; and let him not pronounce loudly (the syllables) kṣā and hi. [^13] 


[^13]:  The text of this Sūtra is corrupt. I read, 'bhavatpurvāṃ bhikṣāmadhyāṃ yācñāntāṃ caret saptākṣarāṃ bhikṣāṃ kṣāṃ ca hiṃ ca na vardhayet' The various readings of the MSS. are, bhikṣāṃ madhyāṃ yacchāṃtāṃ caret saptākṣarāṃ bhim ca na vardhayet, C. T.;--yācñāṃtāṃ caret saptākṣaraṃṇi kṣāṃ ca bhim ca narvyayet, D.;-- yācñāṃtāṃ caret saptākṣarāṃstiṃ rkṣā ba hiṃ na vardhayet, K.; yācñāṃtāṃ tikṣāṃ caret saptākṣarān kṣāṃ ca hiṃ ca na vardhayan, M.; yācanāścāṃtāṃ caret saptākṣarān bhikṣāṃ ka him ka na vardhayet, C. I. The most serious corruption lies in the syllables following saptākṣarāṃ, and I am not certain that my emendation bhikṣāṃ is correct. The commentary on the first half of the Sūtra runs as follows: bhikṣāmantraṃ vyaktam evoccaret bhavacchabdapūrvām bhikṣāśabdamadhyāṃ yācñāpratipa[pā]dakaśabdāṃtāṃ śabdākṣarāṃ [saptākṣarāṃ] ca evaṃ hi bhavati bhikṣāṃ dehi saṃpanno bhavati, 'let him pronounce distinctly the formula employed in begging, beginning with the word bhavat, having the word bhikṣā in the middle, and ending with the word conveying the sense of giving, and containing seven syllables. For thus (the formula), "Lady, give alms," becomes complete.' It is curious that Govinda says nothing about the form saptākṣarām and the feminine terminations of the other adjectives, which do not agree with mantram, a masculine.
