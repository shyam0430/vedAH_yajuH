35. (The pupil) must assist his teacher in making his toilet, shampoo him, attend him while bathing, eat his leavings, and so forth. [^30] 


[^30]:  I read utsādana, 'to shampoo,' while the MSS. have either a lacuna or read ucchādana, and the commentary ācchādana, which is explained by chattradhāraṇa, 'to hold a parasol,' or malāpakarshaṇa, 'to clean.' The ccha is, however, merely owing to a very common faulty pronunciation of tsa. Govinda remarks correctly that the word 'iti,' which follows the enumeration of the services to be performed by the pupil, has the force of 'and so forth.'
