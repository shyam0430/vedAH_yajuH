46. Kātya (declares that) the salutation shall be returned. [^39] 


[^39]:  'Kātya, i.e. a descendant of the Ṛṣi Kata. He was of opinion that officiating priests and the rest must return the salute. As the return of a salute is prescribed for them, it is understood that the other (party) must salute.'--Govinda.
