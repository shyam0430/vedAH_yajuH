17. A Brāhmaṇa (student) shall ask for alms, placing (the word) 'Lady' first, a Kṣatriya placing [^14]  it in the middle, (and) a Vaiśya placing it at the end (of the formula), from (men of) all castes.


[^14]:  Vasiṣṭha XI, 68-70; Gautama II, 35. Govinda thinks that a student should, if possible, beg from people of his own caste. Three castes only are intended by the term 'from all castes.' But see Āpastamba I, 1, 3, 25; Gautama VII, 1 seqq.
