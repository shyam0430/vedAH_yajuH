26. If he desires long life and (bliss in) heaven, [^22]  (he may act) at his pleasure (in the same manner) towards other holy (men), after having received permission from his teacher.


[^22]:  The two copies of the commentary connect the clause, 'if he is desirous of long life and (bliss in) heaven,' with the preceding Sūtra. But see Āpastamba I, 2, 5, 15, where the identical words p. 153 occur. The commentary omits the remainder of the Sūtra, which all my MSS. give here, and inserts it below, after Sūtra 29.
