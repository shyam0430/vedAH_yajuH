13. Husked rice (which has been defiled must be) thrown away. [^5] 


[^5]:  'If it has been defiled by urine and the like and the quantity is small;' this must be understood, because he will declare (below, SÅ«tra 15) that if there is a great quantity (the defiled) portion only shall be thrown away.--Govinda.
