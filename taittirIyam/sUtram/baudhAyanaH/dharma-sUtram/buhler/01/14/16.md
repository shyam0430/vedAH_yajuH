16. Hydromel and preparations of milk (are) purified by pouring them from one vessel into another. [^8] 


[^8]:  'Hydromel, i.e. sour milk, honey, clarified butter, water, and p. 192 grain; a preparation of milk, i.e. curd of two-milk whey (āmikṣā), if these are blemished by the fault of men, and that (blemish must have been caused by) the touch of an impure (person, ucchiṣṭa) only.'--Govinda.
