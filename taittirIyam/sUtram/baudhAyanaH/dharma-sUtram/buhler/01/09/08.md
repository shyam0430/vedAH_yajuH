8. Grain on the threshing-floor, water in wells and reservoirs, and milk in the cowpen are fit for use even (if they come) from a person whose food must not be eaten. [^6] 


[^6]:  'That must be referred to grain on a threshing-floor, and so forth, which has been produced by men whose food must not be eaten, and again is considered to be common to all. In this case, too, what has been received from outcasts and Caṇḍālas, that is defiled. Milk which has been received just at milking-time may be drunk out of a vessel that stands in the cowpen.'--Govinda. As regards the grain produced by low-caste people, the rule probably refers to cases where the land of an Agrahāra or other village is cultivated by men of the lowest castes. The author means to say that in such cases a Brāhmaṇa may take his share from the threshing-floor, where the whole produce of the village-land is stored, without hesitation.
