1. Now (follow the duties) of a Snātaka. [^1] 


[^1]:  5. Regarding the term Snātaka, see Āpastamba I, 11, 30, 1-4. Govinda thinks that the following rules are intended to apply In the first instance to a student who has performed the Samāvartana on completion of his studentship and lives unmarried at home. For though the Smṛti declares it necessary for a student to enter, on completing his term, at once into one of the remaining three p. 159 orders, it may happen; as the commentator observes, that the Snātaka's marriage cannot take place immediately. The correctness of this view is proved by Āpastamba I, 2, 8, and by the fact that below, II, 3, 5, the rules for a married Snātaka are given separately.
