13. (Men of) the four castes (varṇa) who have sons may be witnesses excepting Śrotriyas, the king, ascetics, and those who are destitute of human (intellect). [^12] 


[^12]:  Vasiṣṭha XVI, 28-30. The text has rājanya, 'members of the royal family.' But the parallel passages of other Dharma-sūtras, ej. Viṣṇu VIII, 2, make it probable that the king is meant.
