14. If (the witness rightly) recollects (the facts of) the case (he will receive) commendation from the most eminent men. [^13] 


[^13]:  Āpastamba II, 11, 29, 10. Govinda takes the Sūtra differently. His commentary runs as follows: sākṣidvaye sati rājñā, tatpuruṣaiś ca kiṃ kartavyam ity ata āha || srimṛtau pradhānataḥ pratipattiḥ || prādhānyatas taponirdiṣṭavidyādibhiḥ | tadvacanāt pratipattir niścayaḥ kārya ityadhyāhāraḥ kāryaḥ || 'What shall the king and his officers do, if there are two witnesses? In order to answer this question he says: "On recollection, according to pre-eminence, reliance." According to pre-eminence, i.e. on account of austerities, (being) appointed (as a witness), learning and the like; in accordance with the evidence of such person's conviction. i.e. the decision must be made. The latter word has to be understood.' Govinda then goes on to quote Manu VIII, 73.
