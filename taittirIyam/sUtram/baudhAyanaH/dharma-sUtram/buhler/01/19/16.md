16. Let him (who has given false evidence), drink hot milk during twelve (days and) nights or offer burnt oblations (reciting) the Kūṣmāṇḍa (texts). [^15] 


[^15]:  In accordance with his explanation of Sūtra 14, Govinda thinks that this penance is to be performed by the king and the judges in case they fail to weigh the evidence properly. But p. 205 according to Manu VIII, 106, Viṣṇu VIII, 16, the oblations with the Kūṣmāṇḍas (Taitt. Ār. X, 3-5) are to be offered for uttering in evidence a venial falsehood. That is, no doubt, here, too, the real meaning.
