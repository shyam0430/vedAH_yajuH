1. For slaying a Kṣatriya (the offender) shall [^1]  give to the king one thousand cows and besides a bull in expiation of his sin,


[^1]:  19. Āpastamba I, 9, 24, I. Govinda explains vairaniryātanārtham p. 201 in two ways: 1. in expiation of his sin; 2. in order to remove the enmity of the relatives of the murdered man. He adds all these punishments are really penances (prāyaścittas) to be imposed by the king. Āpastamba has these Sūtras in the section on penances.
