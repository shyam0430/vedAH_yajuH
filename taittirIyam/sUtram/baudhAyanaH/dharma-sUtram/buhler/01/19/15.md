15. In the contrary case (he will) fall into hell. [^14] 


[^14]:  Āpastamba II, It, 29, 9. Govinda and M. read kartṛpatyam for kartapatyam, the reading of the Dekhan and Gujarāt MSS. The explanation of the former term is said to be doṣaḥ, 'sin.' Regarding the ancient word kartapatya, which Govinda and the writer of M. have not understood, see Haradatta on Āpastamba I, 2, 5, 3.
