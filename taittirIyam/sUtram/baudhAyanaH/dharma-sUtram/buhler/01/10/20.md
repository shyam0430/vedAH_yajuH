20. Śūdras living in the service of Āryans shall trim (their hair and nails) every month; their mode [^14]  of sipping water (shall be) the same as that of Āryans.


[^14]:  Āpastamba II, 1, 2, 4-5. The above translation follows Govinda's explanation. But āryādhiṣṭhitāḥ, 'living in the service of Āryans,' may also mean 'superintended by Āryans,' and the rule be taken to refer to the special case of Śūdra cooks, as in the parallel passage of Āpastamba.
