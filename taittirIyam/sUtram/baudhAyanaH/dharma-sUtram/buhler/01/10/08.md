8. 'He is called a foolish man whose conduct is blemished by doubts, and who, clinging to his own fancies, transgresses (the rules of) the Śāstras, because he opposes the fulfilment of the sacred law.' [^4] 


[^4]:  Dharmatantra, translated 'the fulfilment of the sacred law,' is explained in the commentary by dharmasya tantram anuṣṭhānam, by 'the performance of the sacred duties.' It may also mean 'the doctrine of or the treatises on the sacred law.' The Śāstras are the Vedas and the whole body of the sacred literature.
