2. Food which is cooked out of sight must be illuminated (with fire) and be sprinkled with water, [^2] 


[^2]:  Āpastamba II, 2, 3, 9. 'Out of sight,' i.e. not before the eyes of him who eats it.'--Govinda. It would, however, seem that this rule refers to food prepared by Śūdras, without the super-visions of Āryans. For Āpastamba's Sūtra, which contains the same word, parokṣam, 'out of sight,' certainly has reference to that case only, and there is no reason why food prepared by Brahman cooks should be purified before it is eaten.
