27. The offence of neglecting a Brāhmaṇa cannot be committed against a fool who is unacquainted [^21]  with the Veda. For (in offering sacrifices) one does not pass by a brilliant fire and throw the oblations into ashes.


[^21]:  Vasiṣṭha III, 9 note, 10. This Sūtra is added in explanation of the term 'the offence of neglecting a Brāhmaṇa.'
