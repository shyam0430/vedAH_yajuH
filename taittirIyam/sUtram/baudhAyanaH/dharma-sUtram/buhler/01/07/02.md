2. Let him do it with a believing heart; a wise man must not corrupt his mind. The self-existent [^2]  (Brahman) came into existence with a water-vessel. Therefore let him perform (his rites) with a water-vessel.


[^2]:  'A wise man must not corrupt his mind,' i.e. must not doubt or adopt erroneous views regarding the teaching of the Śāstras with respect to the waterpot. It seems to me that this passage indicates the existence of an opposition to the constant carrying of the waterpot in Baudhāyana's times. This is so much more probable, as the custom is now obsolete, and is mentioned in some Purāṇas and versified Smṛtis as one of the practices forbidden in the Kali age; see ej. the general note appended to Sir W. Jones' translation of Manu.
