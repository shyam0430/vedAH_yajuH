25. (If one swallows) cows' urine, cowdung, milk, [^20]  sour milk, clarified butter, and a decoction of Kuśa grass, mixed with barley gruel, that is the most sanctifying Brahmakūrca.


[^20]:  I doubt if the reading of Govinda, yavācāmena (explained p. 327 by yavāgūḥ) saṃyuktam, 'mixed with barley-gruel,' is correct. All the MSS. of the text have yavānām ekasaṃyukto, which I do not understand. Govinda has Brahmakṛcchraḥ instead of Brahmakūrcaḥ. But see the Petersb. Diet. s. v. brahmakūrca.
