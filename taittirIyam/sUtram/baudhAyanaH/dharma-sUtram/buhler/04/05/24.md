24. By dressing in wet clothes, by living in the open air, and by exposing himself to the sun during the light halves of the months Pauṣa (December-January), Bhādrapada (August-September), and Gyeṣṭha (May-June), a Brāhmaṇa is freed from (all) sin excepting crimes causing loss of caste (patanīya). [^19] 


[^19]:  The meaning is that the performer is to stand in wet clothes during the first half of the month Pauṣa, in the cold season; to live in the open air during the first half of Bhādrapada, in the rainy season; and to allow himself to be broiled by the sun in Jyeṣṭha, the hottest time of the hot season.
