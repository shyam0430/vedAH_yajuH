21. But for the transgression of that husband who does not approach a wife who bathed after temporary uncleanness, (the performance of) one hundred suppressions of the breath is prescribed (as a penance). [^10] 


[^10]:  The MSS. of the text read, ṛtusnātāṃ to yo bhāryāṃ niyatāṃ brahmacāriṇīm | niyamātikrame tasya prāṇāyāmaśataṃ smṛtam. The commentary omits the first half of the verse altogether. The latter, as read in the MSS., gives no sense. It seems to me that p. 316 either its end must have been saṃnidhau nopagacchati (as in Sūtra 17), or that a whole half-verse has been lost.
