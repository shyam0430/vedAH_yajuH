6. For partaking of food unfit for eating or drinking, and for selling forbidden merchandise, excepting honey, meat, clarified butter, oil, pungent condiments and bad food, and for similar (offences), he must perform, during twelve days, twelve suppressions of the breath on each day. [^3] 


[^3]:  I read, conjecturally, dvādaśāham, 'twelve days.' The MSS. of the text have dvādaśa dvādaśāham, or corruptions pointing to this reading, and C. I. reads ardhamāsam. Regarding avarānna, 'bad food,' see note on Āpastamba II, 6, 15, 16.
