11. (As regards the mode of life called) Samprakṣālanī, (if, in order to show that) there is no waste of the vegetable (substances) obtained nor [^6]  any hoarding, he turns the dishes, after washing them, upside down, (that is the livelihood called) Samprakṣālanī (living by washing).


[^6]:  1 read, samprakṣālanīti | utpannānām oṣadhīnām prakṣepaṇaṃ p. 290 nāstīti nicayo vā bhājanāni saṃprakṣālya nyubjayatīti samprakṣālanī || M. has nāsti nicayo vā, and C. I. reads also nicayo and omits 'vā' The Dekhan MSS. have nāstīti cayo vā. The description is not very clear; but it seems that a person who lives by the Samprakṣālanī vṛtti must obtain grain and vegetables by begging in such quantities as will suffice for one meal, and prove by the way in which he treats his dishes that he has neither wasted his food nor any store remaining.
