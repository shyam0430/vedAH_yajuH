13. As to the (mode of life called) Pālanī, it is also named Ahiṃsakā (not hurting), and the following (definition) is given. (If) he tries to obtain from virtuous men husked rice or seeds, and maintains (himself) thereby, that (is the mode of subsistence called) Pālanī. [^7] 


[^7]:  The translation of this Satin is merely tentative, as the two MSS. of the commentary omit the text, and contain only a fragment of Govinda's explanation. The latter seems to have differed from my interpretation. The text, as given by the other MSS., runs as follows: pālanīty [pāli°, MSS.] ahiṃsakety evedam uktam bhavati [°tīti, M.] tuṣavihīnāṃs taṇḍulān icchati sajjanebhyo bīgāni vā [cā, D.] pālayatīti pālanī [phāla°, phālani, M.; pālinō, K. D.]
