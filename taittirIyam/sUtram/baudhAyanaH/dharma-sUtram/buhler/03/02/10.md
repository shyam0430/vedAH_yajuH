10. Because, if every (other) livelihood fails, he persistently (dhruvam) supports himself by this (mode of living), it is called Dhruvā (the unchangeable). [^5] 


[^5]:  Both the text and the scanty commentary on this Sūtra are corrupt. K. reads, vṛtter vṛttair avārtāyāṃ tayaiva tasya dhruvaṃ varttayatīti dhruveti parikīrtitā; D. vṛtte vṛttair avārttāthā, &c.; M. vṛtte vṛtter avṛttāyām avṛttāyāṃ tathaiva tasyāḥ ddhṛvaṃ varttamānād iti, &c.; C. I. vṛttervṛtter āvartāyāmāvartāyām tathaiva tasyāṃ dhruvaṃ vartanād iti, &c. The Telugu copy omits the text. From the commentary it is clear that Govinda read at the beginning of the Sūtra vṛttervṛtter,' and the Telugu copy proves that 'tayaiva' is the correct reading. I restore the Sūtra conjecturally; as follows, vṛttervṛtter avārttāyāṃ tayaiva tasya dhruvaṃ vartanād it dhruveti parikīrtitā.
