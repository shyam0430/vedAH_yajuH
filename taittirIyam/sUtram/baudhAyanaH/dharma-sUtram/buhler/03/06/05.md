5. 'Thou art barley, thou art the king of grains, thou art sacred to Varuṇa and mixed with honey, the sages have proclaimed thee an expeller of all guilt and a means of purification.' [^2] 


[^2]:  According to Govinda, Vāmadeva is the Ṛṣi of these Mantras. The phrase, 'Thou art sacred to Varuṇa,' is to be explained, according to Govinda, by the fact that offerings presented to Varuṇa frequently consist of barley. 'Honey' means, according to some, 'sweet butter,' with which the dish is seasoned.

'Ye barley-grains are clarified butter and honey, ye barley-grains are water and ambrosia. May you remove my guilt and all my sins:'

'Those committed by words, by acts, and by evil thoughts; ill-fortune and the night of all-destroying time,--all that avert from me, ye barley-grains.'

'(From the sin of eating) food which had been worried by dogs or pigs, or which had been defiled by crows and impure men, from the sin of disobedience towards mother and father,--from all that purify me, ye barley-grains.'

'From the dreadful (guilt of) mortal sins and of the crime (of serving) a king, from the wrong done to infants or aged men, from (the guilt) of stealing gold, of breaking my vows, of sacrificing for an un-worthy man, of speaking evil of Brāhmaṇas,--from all that purify me, ye barley-grains.'

'From (the sin of eating) the food of many men, of harlots and of Śūdras, of (partaking of) funeral dinners and of (the food given by) persons who are unclean on account of a death or a birth, of that given by thieves, or at a funeral sacrifice offered to one who lately died,--from all that purify me, ye barley-grains.'
