[^6]:  The word vedādayaḥ, which occurs also in some MSS. of Vasiṣṭha (XXII, 9), must be explained, according to the analogy of karmādi, the beginning of the sacrifices' (Sāyaṇa on Taitt. Ār. II, 7, 5), by 'the initial verses of the Vedas.' The Pāvamānīs are added on the authority of Govinda alone.
