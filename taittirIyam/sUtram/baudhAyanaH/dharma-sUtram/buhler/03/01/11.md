11. (Viz.) the skin of a black antelope, a water-pot, a staff, a yoke for carrying burdens, (and) a sickle. [^3] 


[^3]:  The vīvadha, 'a yoke for carrying burdens,' consists usually of a bamboo pole, to the ends of which two ropes are attached for fastening the loads. Kuthahārī, 'a sickle,' seems to be the name of a particular kind of sickle, since Govinda explains it by vāsavasāsanadātram. He adds that the term includes 'a spade' (kuddāla) and other implements.
