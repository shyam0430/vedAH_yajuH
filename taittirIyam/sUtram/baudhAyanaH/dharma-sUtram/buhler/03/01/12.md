12. He desires to go forth, after having offered a Traidhātavīya (offering) or a Vaiśvānarī (iṣṭi). [^4] 


[^4]:  The meaning is that on the evening before his departure from the old home he is to offer the Traidhātavīya-homa. According to the Śrauta-sūtras (see the Petersb. Dict. s. v. traidhātavī) the latter offering always occurs at the end of a great sacrifice. Hence it is appropriate for a person who wishes to begin a new mode of life.
