At the time when the meal is to be cleansed, one cleanses the grains.

#####  Commentary

This takes place after the caru-pot has been put on. The taṇḍulas are the unhusked grains, piṣṭa is the ground flour. In Sanskrit a distinction is made between śasya, the corn in the field, dhānya, corn with the husk, taṇḍula, grains without husks, anna, roasted grains.
